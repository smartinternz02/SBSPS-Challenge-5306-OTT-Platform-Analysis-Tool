## UI Creation

The UI is created using **React.JS**. We have used different npm modules along with React to increase the functionality of the web app. These modules can be found in `package.json`

File Structure of the UI:

`package.json`: It contains all the meta data and the dependency data related to the react app.

`src folder`: This folder contains all the code that was written in order to create the UI. This folder contains all the assets, components (with their stylesheets), code related to firebase and redux.

`public folder`: This folder contains the root html file (index.html) along with favicon icon.

`manifest.yml`: This file is required to deploy the app on IBM Cloud Foundry.
