## APP Creation
The Apps are created using **Flask framework (by Python)** which runs with **Gunicorn Python WSGI HTTP server which handles POST requests**
The app provides an interface layer between the main python file and the React UI.
Various parts of the app:
- `manifest.yaml`: The file is an application deployment descriptor. This means that it contains information needed to deploy the application on cloud doundry
- `requirements.txt`: This file is used for specifying what python packages which are required to run the project.
- `nltk.txt`: This file consists of a list of corpora to be installed to run the project.
- Main app file
- Main sentiment/recommender python file
