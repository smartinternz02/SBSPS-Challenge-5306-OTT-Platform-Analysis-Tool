Main Title,Full Review
Needs More Titles,Netflix is supposed to be the one-stop- shop for all types of visual entertainment. However Netflix India lacks range and diversity. Several TV shows and movies are missing from Netflix India which are available in other countries— so India is missing out on some quality cinema.     Some functional errors on the website and app make the platform a user nightmare. The search option shows titles which are unavailable which is very disappointing.     Overall for a subsription plan like Netflix’s I was expecting a lot more diversity and choices which was not the case. Hope they upgrade their services for India.   
BEST EXPERIENCE EVER!!!,The Best Streaming Service Comparing To All Others.     The Good Thing Is How They Classify The Genre & Matches & Suggest Movies Based on our Watch History.     The Library Of Tv Show Movies & Series Has The Original Content.     They Can Update There Subscriptions For Annual Payment Also As They Only Supports Monthly Payments But The Good Point Is They Provide Gift Cards To My Account.     Different Subscriptions Plan Is Also A Good Options Given As It Is Well Said That Netflix and Chill     Just Download Whatever You Want & Watch It Without Any Internet Connection.   
Loaded with Good Shows but Poor Service,I have used netflix on both mobile app and a website version too but there are some very silly problems that I wish it didn't had.     Problems -        The app lacks basic functionality to change volume level. You have to do it manually using buttons. It is not given on screen.        The search option both on site and app does not work properly. The shows present in netflix dont appear on search results and have to be browsed.        The search option takes quite a long time to search and show the results.        The app somtimes hang for no reason at all. You are watching a movie or a series and in midst of that it will just hang but sound will continue to come.        Netflix has some great shows and movie series but there are some movies missing from the several movie series.        Netfilx India lacks so many great movies and shows which are available in other countries.        The subscription plans of netflix are very costly. Netflix says that it's base plan starts from 199 a month. Sounds good but it is actually 2 times costlier than disnep+ hotstar.        The subscription plans are very confusingly written and executed. Hard for a new person to get in to watching netflix.        Netflix has started including anime which sounds great but still the number of anime available is still less.           Overall though I like watching netflix but I am not at happy with it's features functioning and service both in website and app. NETFLIX can actually DO BETTER !   
Good service but issue with payments,I like watching netflix but somehow not able to solve the auto debit payment method.     I use a SBI card but they do not take it as a valid method of payment to cut every month.     I have to always add my card again and pay each month.     otherwise love their service   
Star of Entertainment,Netflix is the best platform that connects people from all over the globe.     As an Indian I only watched Hindi films or Hindi web shows. But then I began watching Spanish Portuguese and Italian movies. I completely forgot to watch a Hindi movie.     What talent what plot and most importantly what actor. I thank Netflix for introducing such web series and films. Because if I hadn't seen other language films I would have never met a real talent.     Netflix delivers three streaming plans: Basic Standard and Premium. The plan you choose will decide how many devices you can monitor. The payment is monthly and the collections of movies in front of your eyes. Even the quality of each film animation web series documentary shows of extremely theatrical quality. The sound and colour give you a theatrical impression.     You also get a movie trailer coming up too if you're interested you can add those movies to your list. SO when the movie is available it will be straight on your list.     You can easily classify your films according to your tastes and age. It has a parental lock as well. So no need to worry kids won't be able to watch an adult movie.     Netflix boasts a variety of collections in children's films as well. Anytime you can switch on Netflix and choose what you like to watch. Even if you watched half a movie don't worry you can pick up the movie where you left it last time.     All those film enthusiasts what are you waiting for? Join Netflix now and take advantage of its free trial. I guarantee you will go insane and you will love it.     Personally I am asking Netflix for one thing that please add some black and white Bollywood movie collections and complete your platform.   
Money stealer,They dont allow'auto renewal' to be set off. Till Nov last year I was paying monthly. But suddenly without any confirmation they start deducting money from my account. WITHOUT ANY CONFIRMATION FROM ME. And when I asked them why they are doing so then their customer care straightway says its our policy. How you take money from my bank account without having my consent?   
A genuine app for web series lovers,It's a nice app i have been using it for quite some time and I don't find any fault... Though it requires a very high internet connection because of which i would give it 4 stars and also the prices are reasonable...   
Netflix| review | A Better Platform|,Website- Netflix.com     Netflix is an American over-the-top content platform also it's a production company. It is founded by Reed Hastings Marc Randolph in 1997. Netflix is the best platform for watching shows series & movies even they produced their own shows also. On this website we can see International & Indian content at the same time.     I have been using Netflix for the past several months & I love their content. It also has a Netflix app for android & iOS users. The service of Netflix is very good I am very impressed by their service. Netflix shows are very well it reflects the modern Indian community.     Netflix shows are very good but at the same time some of the Indian series is below the average. So sometimes I am disappointed by these shows. But the International contents are marvelous.     Netflix has a completely optimized app. The quality of the videos is very impressive.     Netflix is more & more popular day by day. And I recommended this to all adults.     Thank you for reading this review.     Please like this review.   
Netflix my favourite binge app,I have been using netflix from past six months all in all its a nice app for binge watching but nothing is perfect same is the case with this app so I will divide my review in pros and cons.     Pros:     1.variety of shows.     2.great interface.     3.good shows.     4.trusted app.     Cons:     1.not free.     2.limited downloads and screens for budget plans.     3.frequency of uploading indian shows is less.     In the end I will conclude among all it is the best but nothing is perfect there is always scope for improvement.   
Source of Entertainment,Netflix is the best platform for watching shows and movies. Video quality is superb. We can watch international & national serial anytime and anywhere.   
A Online store of web series and movies,Netflix is run by Amazon company. But it has prime membership subscription. I personally used Netflix for 6 months. It has its own production team. All the types of web series and movies I can find here. Currently I watched mirzapur season 3. Flash and some other web series. We can also download the shows offline.   
Very bad experience.,I am a premium subscriber of netflix. Last month my premium I'd of netflix is restored automatically. I am disappointed in the service of netflix. I sent many times complaint about restored my ID to netflix but no response. So I am very disappointed and broke my smart phone. Buffering process is also very bad in this netflix. Many times it became slow or shut the phone in background. It's premium features are also very bad performance. Phone is heat up in half an hour. So I gave only one star for this disgusted netflix.   
Netflix,Live stream is one of the newest thing we have to be able to watch while we're away from home. Netflix has great quality service. You can binge watch series that you may have wanted to watch but didn't want to watch from season 4. Just start it at season 1 and go. Don't have to be at home you just take it with you. Sit outside by your pool and still watch your favorite movie. Netflix is up on new movies. Adding new ones everyday. They also show you what you might be interested in by what you watch. A big variety of new movies and series as well as old ones you might have forgotten. Need to take advantage of Netflix versus cable or satellite TV.   
A nice place to watch movies,Its incredible the mass of series and movies in this site the best site of Streaming in all senses the only thing I see it is the fact that has blocked some series and movies in my country.   
Dirty app will spoil India Future,Netflix should be close have dirty series nd it will misguide to every person.....................so close it   
Costly And Not Worth,I want to share my personal experience on netflix.com .Netflix is very costly and and give less variety of content most of them are 18+ . I tried 1 month ffree trial but paying 649RS is not worth it to pay try other app but do not go for the subscription it is waste of money all of them give 18+ content which is not good for children.     I am also a student and I watch hot scene with my parents that is not for me at all     Boycott netflix   
Bulbbul,Well this review is regarding the new movie on netflix i.e. bulbbul. I really loved the movie especially the story line was really amazing. All the actor has done a great job. It was worth watching Rahul Bose after so long.   
Creative Content But a bit Expensive.,Netflix is becoming more and more popular day by day beacuse it is making contents in regional languages which attracts more crowd. the contents are for all age roups and mostly for all types of taste. I love it.   
Superb,One of the best app. The content is really amazing the video works really fine and the quality of the video is tremendous.     It also manage to run on slow internet that's wat I like about it   
Netflix,I had an terrible experience with Netflix.It is one of the worst app in terms of access It takes a lot of time to open and load content on netflix.The app keeps on logging out automatically.The app was ok before but lately since the new update I have exeperienced a lot of problems.Mainly I am sad because all of my downloads randomly got deleted.This is very annoying.Sometimes Picture quality on netflix is very low with hazy and unstable audio.Unlike other apps like hulu there is no frequent update in the library of TV shows and series.If you like to watch TV show than Netflix won't be the best option for you.Some of the shows on Netflix are highly boring.Netflix consumes huge amount of data It can eat up more than 1GB/hour depending on how much quality you demands while watching movies and TV shows.Netflix has a high subscription value which is not affordable by everyone.Netflix is very slow it takes lot of time to stream video on netflix.Some of the limitations of Netflix are as follows.     1) .AVAILABILITY OF SHOWS - If there is a show on TV you love to watch the latest episode of it will not be available on netflix right away even though its previous seasons will be steaming on netflix.     2) .CUSTOMER SERVICE - I really had an terrible experience with their customer executives.Netflix Customer care executive are really ruthless/worst Once I cancelled my account before end of the billing cycle but still they charged my card and clearly refused to refund me the amount which Frustrated me a lot.     3) .SELECTION DEPENDS ON YOUR LOCATION - Netflix provides you a selection while preferring your location.Major drawbacks of this is that on some location content will be very good and on some location it can be very bad.     4) .USER FRIENDLY - Netflix cannot be considered as user-friendly since depending on your data cap Netflix may use all of your data very quickly.     5) .Much of netflix's licensed content are on short term contracts.This means movies and shows are removed and added regularly without any warning and prior notice.     6) .SUBSCRIPTION PLANS - Netflix charges high amount for its subscription plans It's starting plans includes basic plan of r300/month which is much costly.     I STRICTLY RECOMMEND NOT TO PREFER NETFLIX.   
NEVER DISAPPOINTED,Hello friends     My name is Shivam and I have been streaming Netflix since 2018 and on the basis of my experience I am going to share me review upon Netflix. I will discuss about several points which I like and which I don't like here we go.     First of all i would like to discuss about quality of streaming in my personal opinion the quality of pictures are fantastic even in 480p the quality is amazing and I see everything texture and color very clearly even if I increase the quality to 720 no doubt quality of picture is super awesome and I see it consumes less data even in 720p this is all about the result of best data management is also work on auto mode in which the quality is selected according to your speed of internet if the speed is good then it automatically select the 720p of higher 1080p but in my opinion this feature is only for the people who have broadband service because higher quality takes more data.     Moving further now we talking about the series available on the Netflix. There are many famous web series like sacred games sex education stranger things umbrella academy and many more which are exclusively available only on Netflix also there are many movies which are available only on Netflix and the one most important fact about Netflix is every English movies available with subtitles which we Indians like the most to watch movies with English audio and English subtitles.     Additionally the price of subscription are little bit expensive as compared to other streaming applications like amazon prime and Hotstar not every one afford Netflix this is only thing which I dislike about Netflix.     the download option is also available if you want to save for offline and want to watch it later then this option available.     Everything is given for you in settings option in which you simply manage what you want or want you don;t want if you want to stream only on WiFi then its also present and many other options like in which quality you want to download so you can choose the quality option according to you storage.     Netflix also offers you a free trail for a month and you can cancel membership whenever you want there is not any restrictions.     if you want Netflix for your children then this is the bet option for you because it comes with kid mode as a parents you can see what your children search on Netflix.     I hope my friends this review is going to help many people to choose Netflix.     Thank you.   
Netflix Killing The Lockdown,The most popular OTT platform has really taken over the viewership of the majority of households through its top of the line Web Series kicking in every now and then.     They have been coming up with a wide range of critically acclaimed web series of the West now streaming in for the Indian audience. It is easy to subscribe to Netflix and the pricing is also very affordable on a monthly basis if you look at the expense which the whole family can consume as per their preference.     Whenever you get stuck with any subscription or payment issue the Customer Service is prompt and responds aptly in times of need. I am impressed with the Product Quality of their Video content which is delivered in UHD and HD quality. Its a Reliable OTT platform which has a nice fluid interface of its website which is easy to navigate and the Mobile App of Netflix is also equally responsive.   
Best Movie Watching Experience,Netflix is very good and best live movie experience. The picture quality is good and very satisfies with the content   
Great Source Of TV Streaming Entertainment,I have been a member of Netflix for over twenty-five years and it's been a great experience. I enjoy Netflix for its TV streaming and it's outstanding movies and documentaries. There is never a dull moment with Netflix especially during this Covid-19 Pandemic time of quarantine at home. A must have.   
NETFLIX,Netflix is one of the most Popular Streaming Services in India. It Provides Movies and web series. the quality and the sound/audio of the Movies they are providing is the best. They are providing the movies and web series from Hollywood Bollywood Turkish Japan and from many more but most of them are from Hollywood the contents providing of the series or movies are unique exciting Thrilling Romantic etc and they are also offering cartoons shows and movies for Kids also that very Interesting thing. I have been using Netflix for the past 1 year and my experience is good.     The subscription charges are also quite cheap if you are taking it combined with your friends 4 to 6 people can watch movies or web series at one time with one Account according to plan to your taking now it is also offering Netflix Moblie Plan of Rs 199 only.   
Lucifer,Lucifer and money heist are the best web series on Netflix...it contain a number of good series and films like Dictator Irishman Friends Locke & Key etc. Netflix is better than prime video.   
Worth subscribing...good content,NETFLIX is the most streamed website in india it really has a good collection of movies and series .     something that you wont find in a typical indian bollywood movie.     far better than the old boring bollywood movies.     netflix gives a huge range of hollywood series which is worth watching .   
Vulgar non interesting content,The content on netflix india is not based on viewer discretion but rather caters to the simple corporate logic of giving sex  violence and abusive language. Not a single indian series is watch worthy. It seems they think of India as some tribal people doing hu la la in jungle.     The editors for indian edition are to be blamed.   
Best movie app I have,I love netflix...great movies and an awesome way to pass time. I found a show called blacklist that I just couldn't stop watching. Each episode just got better and better. finally just had to finish the whole season and be done with it   
Highly satisfied,Netfilx Provide alot of interesting and thrilling web series movies and other content as compared to others. The resolution and the service is so good !   
Refund,Netflix has initiated my refund in August that's 799 and was told will get refund within 30 working days but i did not got refund I called Netflix they said that the refund is in progress will have to wait more after a month I called Netflix they said that will take     more 15 days i said k i called after 15 days they said it was declined after 3 months nw they got to know that the refund has been declined and nw they have given a list stating that need this detail from bank just fooling around pathetic service ever got will never recommended anyone for Netflix beaware   
Netflix,Very bad and bad     In short they are “chor”     I am create new account on received msg.     And the cut charges from my account     It is disgusting     Netflix chor hai   
Netflix Is not up to date.,Netflix is one of the most famous websites on the Net.     It has almost all of the tv series released anywhere as well as some movies.     But Netflix is ny up to date for any series except the NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES.     For example. AMC'S The Walking Dead netflix only has 9 seasons of this series while AMC has released 10th season already.     Netflix doesnt have the license to stream the other lastest seasons of almost all the series available through other channels like AMC.     Well we can say that we are spending a lot of money on this website while we dont even recieve updated seasons on time.     This is the biggest flaw present on NETFLIX.   
Worth trying,This company is foreign based So the number of Indian movies and series are very less.Even all the english movies and series are not available.Old movies are also hard to find. Although it's the most famous platform for the release of the movies and series the cost per account is very high for a middle class person.They give only one month of free trail version. The number of accounts are also restricted to five and more number of accounts cannot be played at once.     So it totally depends upon you whether to subscribe as per your economic and entertainment neends   
Very good,I install this app to watch latest movies and documentaries. This is really usefull app I install this again recently but doesn't take any subscription. I'll take this as soon. Moreover this is useful app.   
Too Costly to Use.,Hello Everyone.!     Netflix is online video streaming Platform where we can find Hollywood Bollywood Movies and so many tv series. And it is user friendly so that anyone can use it without getting irritated. now Netflix has started producing its own Movies and tv series which are only available on Netflix.Everything is Cool about Netflix except its Subscription literally is too expensive. To watch in HD you need to get subscription of Rs 649 for only one month. and there are other plans too which are cheaper but they are not of any use.     So I didn't like the subscription plans of Netflix. It should charge less so that mostly everyone can afford it.     Thank you.   
Netflix.,Those who wanna enjoy in high quality hollywood movies for them netflix is the best platform.     but it is too expensive to buy the premium plan for netflix so it is better for us to share the cost with our friends.     NOW in india netflix has launched a new plan for indian customers that is 200rs per month.   
Nice site,This site is very good for the people which like to see serials and web series. the video quality is great . movies are also available in high quality in this website . netflix app is very well featured for kids also . overall this website is very good for people who like to watch movies in their free time .   
Netflix - Pathetic Services and Worst CustomerCare,Netflix is providing worst services to customers. They are really ruthless/worst service provider while responding to a customer.     I cancelled my account before end of billing cycle but still they charged my card and clearly refused to refund me the amount.     Their Customer care executives "Amita & Hanif" are even worst in responding and they even don't have the courtesy to support their customer.     Netflix is a provider who Don't even have the Customer care Mail ID so customer are not even write to them for their concern. Customer will not be having any evidence if they contact customer care because there are only 2 ways to connect - Voice and Chat and both are in control of Netflix that when how and what to respond.     My suggestion / recommendation is BIG NO to NETFLIX. They are worst.   
Not value for money.,So are you guys seriously paying ₹; 800 per month for movies and tv shows? . and still just 4-5 screens.     I agree that there is good content on netflix but the pricing is too high for that. If you compare this from its main compitetor amazon prime they offer you alot more things than just movies/tv shows. Also the Indian audience enjoys prime more than netflix ( majority) .   
NETFLIX the WORST,Netflix is the worst website becuase they are just thiefs who automatic money from account  First of all they do not mention about automatic subscription.And then cut automatic money from account.also not showing good gesture when called in the customer care.   
Netflix the worst,First of all they do not mention about automatic subscription. And then they cut automatic money from the credit card which is not bearable. Also when called in their customer care they do not show good gesture. Again when asked for refund they say you cannot.. .   
Best for Movies?,Netflix is the best movie watching platform all around the globe. It fulfils all the requirement of a Movie Lover. Netflix browsing movie and tv- series is up to the mark. And updates never upset the audience. They also provide One- month free subscription and we can also cancel our subscription before they charge us. Is'nt cool?     I love watching Netflix produced movies and TV series. they are highly VFX used and so much attractive.     Go for it. Netflix is what Every teenager wants.   
The best streaming website till date!,Netflix is one the most popular streaming service in India. It is a platform where you can stream and watch movies and web series. Below are some of the reasons for which I would recommend Netflix over other streaming platforms:        Video and Audio quality on Netflix is the best in it’s class.        The UI ( User Interface) of the Netflix app is amazing and user friendly.        The movies and web series are available in most of the languages spoken in India.        The subscription price ofcourse. It costs only Rs. 500 per month for the Basic plan to Rs. 800 for the Premium plan which doesn’t hurt the pocket of a middle class man.           Also Netflix releases some of the stuff of it’s own as well which is only available on Netflix.     One such example is Delhi crime.     I personally have watched many movies such as Crazy Stupid Love Sex tape and Beauty and the beast and web series such as Sacred Games Sex education and Delhi crime and would recommend each one of you reading my review to buy the subscription and enjoy streaming movies and web series in the best quality available on the internet.   
Netflix,Netflix one of the best online source of movies original series created by their production. You take ayy subject you will find the series on that one like space family drama comedy adult relationship regional and international.     One of the best place for time pass groups. Obe in all right place.   
NETFLIX,Netflix is one of the online movie site.Its provides original series and movies.Once I used be a member of netflix.My experience are as follows:     1.QUALITY: I agree that netflix provides the best quality.But You cant download to your file.either you watch it online or download will be on app or site you cant tranfer.     2.CONTENT: The contents or most of the movies and series are from hollywood.There are few which are from Bollywood.And those are old one.You will not find the new releases movie.And you will not find all the movies.Each time I searched and each time I became sad.     3.SUBSCRIBTION: The best things is that it will give you a chance for one month trial.But you have to register by your dabit card .And after one month you have to pay.     4.PRODUCT VALUE: I think the subscribtion charge is expansive in order to the product is providing.You will not found all the movies and also not find the new releases movie.There only few bollywood movies and series.And it take highest subscribtion charge among all.     So it was my experience.if you want go and use.Your experience will may be different.i hope it will help you.   
Paying money to watch movies which are on TV,This application has movies tv series shows which are already there in tv or telecasted on tv. Waste of money to watch contents which are already available for free. I don't know why people buy Netflix account.     Bad features:     Waste of money: we can watch all those movies for free outside in various websites and in television no need to pay money for those stuff. People are really mad if they buy a Netflix account.     Fake free trial: They say we give a free one month trial but to experience that one month duration free trial we have to pay for the future plans that we will take after that trial.     They take card details so that they can deduct money after one month.     My personal point of view: There is no need for all these Netflix accounts because all the content in this application is available outside for free of cost. So better don't spend your money on such stuffs which is available for absolutely free.   
I am Now On Netflix,I am using netflix app from last 1 month and I am so imprresed from its Uniqe content . Netflix's orignal series and movies is great . Netflix provide me best content that I want . Tv Dth channel is so old thing This is time of Online video streming and Netflix is No.1 from video streaming app . I am forgot tv and swithched to Netflix app . I am using its 1 month free subscription plan and now I continious with 650rs plan . So guys I you want great content thant you want to watch then netflix is best choice for you .   
Netfilx,Its awseome and amazing the movie and espiode are based on true story the way they director the movie are awsome if u are wasting some money on other so spend on this this is the awsome platform to watch they are many serious and other type of movie .if u looing for a adult movie or horror movie this website give the best option in your entire life.   
Good site,The netflix is very good site and for paid members netflix releases webseries.     which is very good like sacred games  Ghoul etc. I think sacred games is very good web series of india . also netflix is best site for watching webseries.     In netflix there is no add only you have to pay the membership fees and watch all series of netflix by unlimited streaming.   
Best website,Love it really the coolest one I ever seen the future is here install the coolest app to enjoy your best series with netflixes.????????????????????????????     Dmmm the best series you can find I love the combo of suspence of series with such nd ultimate characters its now my favourite timepass to achieve my intest goal   
Costly but worth,Yes netflix has been a streaming gaint in the U.S. but when it came to India it got even bigger.     I think the class and panache of the shows and movies that Netflix offers are far superior to other contemporaries of this era. It costs around 800₹ PM for 4 screens 650₹ PM for 2 screens and 500₹ PM for 1 screen. However you can't watch Ultra HD in 650₹ and 500₹ plans as well can't watch HD in 500₹ plan.     This still makes it very much costly for the Indian audience who are used to hotstar and Amazon prime.     But albeit amazon or hotstar it offers 1 month free trail period where you have full access to all the TV shows without ad commercials and thus it is an outstanding prospect especially for the youth.     It is a platform made for binge watching tv shows over the weekend. Sacred games has received such appraisal and warmth among the Indian audience as well as in foreign. This is something we have to take pride in and even though it is costly one should definitely trial the free month.   
Switch to Netflix stop watching TV,Hello friends today I am sharing my review on popular video streaming site NETFLIX.     I am using Netflix for last 6 months now. It is my companion on boring days. As I live away from house and cant get a TV it is the best option for me. If you are a student or live away I think it is a best option for you.     There are many hollywood and bollywood movies shows series on Netflix which you can watch just with a click.     The best thing about Netflix is its content which is far better then other companies. I have watched many shows here.     Moreover it is easy to use.     But it is quiet heavy on your pocket. Thats only bad thing about it.     One of my favourite thing on Netflix is their 'originals' which are way awesome.     I hope you liked my review try using Netflix it is way awesome.   
Instead of tv,Hi I have come across this app 2 years back . I am one of the member of Netflix.com . There are so many Hollywood movies but few Indian movies . Regarding to Customer service was good. Its user friendly app . We can access movies from year wise and along with we can view imdb rating also . There is an options like video quality & subtitles. Who are the people wants to relax while sleeping watch netflix.com movies and serials. Quality of the vidoes are awesome. It takes some time to retrieve the data. You can download the app from playstore . Start using it instead of tv. Its very entertainment for me . Thank u     HP   
NETFLIX REVIEW - SWITCH TO AMAZON PRIME INSTEAD !!,Netflix was a customer centric company according to me TILL* I had to deal with them today. I am a customer with them for a year now and this time due to some error at their end they were not able to charge the payment from the card that was attached with them from the beginning. They sent me a mail that they were not able to charge the payment for some issue and as soon as I got the mail they blocked my services right then and there when I had a family and friends get together and more than 20 people were watching a movie and suddenly I was locked out of the account and when I tried to login it showed me an unclear balance update on the screen to which I had to open up my mail which has been used for netflix subscription.     Now this was such a humiliation Imagine all of your family and friends sitting at your place to watch a movie together and they now have to see your face with a sorry look on it cause the company was not able to charge your card fr some problem at their end. I am saying at their end cause I tried to make a payment manually myself and the payment went through at "ONCE"! but this wasted my get together cause I did it after they left when I had faced the humiliation already. Then I decided to talk to their customer service department to address my issue to make sure that this doesn't repeat again and to my surprise the customer support guy was even a bigger IDIOT than thi stupid self proclaimed globally successful company.     I am pasting a chat which I had with the NETFLIX customer support executive and you will be amazed how that idiot was praising the company global presence instead of help and solving the issue. On top of that the people there dont care about the issue explained. He asked me whats my problem was when I had already written a 400 words description of the issue I was facing.     Before you start readying let me remind you its Saturday weekend when no banks works!     Below pasted is the chat log: DO READ IT!     Opening Message for explaining the issue     Me(Client) : I have been you people for more than 1 year now and you people are so DIS-RESPECTFUL towards your customer that if there was some issue with the payment you people just put the account on hold right away after just sending a mail. I must tell you people should seriously learn some customer service or sooner you will have no one to service. There are bigger players entered in the market now like amazon. I think they are 10 times lesser on price and much better for service. Need to talk here.     You are now chatting with: Jorge     Reply from Netflix Jorge: Hello there! I'll be glad to help you today can I have your name?     Me(Client) : Hello Jorge I am really pissed right now noting against you my friend but to your Luck today your working with netflix and I am irritated from them     Me(Client) : you need any details from me to pull up my acc     Reply from Netflix Jorge: Thanks Nakul don't worry I'll help you out in the best way I can     Reply from Netflix Jorge: I have your accout right now     Reply from Netflix Jorge: What seems to be the issue?

We allow our customers to cancel at any time and can help with this if you’d like. We’ll be expanding our global content library and launching more originals than ever before over the next year so we hope that you check us out again if you decide to cancel     Me(Client) : they are much cheaper and much uh better service     Me(Client) : my friend I would suggest you dnt just copy and paste a script that has been handed over to you     Me(Client) : if a client is pissed you should be smart enough to redress the issue and get him out of there rather than pasting a stupid script for global expansion plans that means a DIME to me     Me(Client) : I hope I am making sence to you     Reply from Netflix Jorge: This is not an issue     Me(Client) : sence     Reply from Netflix Jorge: We were not able to collect the payment     Me(Client) : sure I can see that     Reply from Netflix Jorge: You must get in contact with your bank to solve the issue that you are having with your credit card     Me(Client) : you could have given me a day or 2     Me(Client) : this is a weekend and I am sure u understand banks are not owned by the WORLD FAMOUS no service capable company NETFLIX     Me(Client) : Instead of doing this small company attitude of just sending a mail and stopping the service you could have allowed atleast 3-4 days for me to resolve this     Reply from Netflix Jorge: We do not offer this as a feature so you need to solve the issue that you are having and then you can rejoin us after that     Me(Client) : you know even a startup company wouldnt behave this cheap as so call GLOBALLY EXPANSION COMPANY "NETFLIX" is     Me(Client) : dude     Reply from Netflix Jorge: Ok is there anything else I can help you with?     Me(Client) : trust me ur not working for a stupid company but u are not a good representative for them as well     Me(Client) : I am going to update this conversation to most blogs     Me(Client) : and make sure people know what you people have to offer     Reply from Netflix Jorge: We offer prepaid streaming service     Me(Client) : you should change ur job from a customer representative I suggest. cause you cannot even service a simple request.     Me(Client) : I could have handled this much better my friend     Me(Client) : I pity     Me(Client) : take care.     =     I would suggest you don't go for these idiots rather than go for a company that atleast understand your problems sometimes.     CHEERS!   
Netflix- very limited series and movies,Apart from their high definition quality stuff that can be watched is very limited. I fail to understand why people subscribe to it. Anythinf whatsoever I search is not in there like I watch russel peters show but they hardly have 4 recordings. I think netflix is good for starters but for people who have specific interest in good english series and movies its a waste This is the second time I have discontinued my subscription.   
Best television replacement,I have been using netflix for the past 2 months on my Vu smart tv and don't want to even watch regular television. The content on Netflix is just awesome. I have already about 10 netflix series like Stranger things 13 reasons why and many more. I have a netflix subscription for about 900 rupees which let's me use the service on more than 1 platform . The smart tv interface is better according to me as it's more fun to navigate on the smart tv app then on a computer or a mobile device . There are options for resolution quality subtitles and captions. Also options for audio setting  stereo or 5.1 channel sound.     It also runs fine on a 4 Mbps internet connection which is also being used by various mobile devices simultaneously . There is one flaw sometimes the sound quality is not so clear and you have to switch between the audio settings of stereo and 5.1 channel audio. But overall this is one of the best entertainment websites on the internet. It's even better than the Amazon prime entertainment website which is famous nowadays in India. I would personally recommend this product for people who are fed up the ordinary indian entertainment channels and want a serious upgrade to their tv watching experience.   
Beware Guys : Don't take trial of netflix,Guys Netflix attracts by giving a 1 month trail free of cost. They take credit card details from you for providing trail. They say that they will only charge credit card when you will opt for paid membership which is minimum Rs 500 per month. But they will automatically charge your credit card on the very next day of your trail expiry date without intimating or informing you . You will know when you will got message from your credit card company that you are charged. Guys this happened to me. My credit card company says that you have given details to Netflix so you speak to them only we cannot help. Guys that means if some one hacks netflix server then they can charge your credit card with your full limit say 1 lacs rupees and your bank will say we cannot help talk to netflix.     When I spoke to netflix customer service they showed me their terms and conditions where it is mentioned clearly that they will charge credit card automatically if you don't cancel your free member ship before 1 month free trail. So beware!     Terms and Conditions as per netflix website:     We will charge your Payment Method for your monthly membership fee at the end of the free trial period unless you cancel your membership prior to the end of the free trial period. To view the monthly membership price and end date of your free trial period visit our website and click the "Billing details" link on the "Your Account" page.   
An awesome website for films,Hello my dear friends I would like to share my personal experience of using netflix services. actually this was a great experience for me . I am using this website since last three years and this experience was very joyful for me. I can watch latest movies at very reasonble price. I think it is much better than tv.        the layout of the website is very easy you can easily navigate the pages without any problem. website is very easy to use everyone can easily use the website. the android application is also very decent.        it works even on slow internet. thre is no issue with its connectivity. I think this website is developped in very good technology. I love this website and always will be.      
Netflix.com is good,Hello guys today I want to share my experience with Netflix.com. I love their service and it's a great way to choose what you really want. Unlike in India we need to watch shows that are shown to us by Cable TV operators which is always with repeating movies and serials. Netflix is a place you need to subscribe to them and watch unlimited movies TV shows etc.I was happy that netflix has come to Indian audience. I am using is that the collection of movies and TV shows are very limited. I hope very soon they just provide all the data like full movies collection and all other features.   
Highly Priced - Not satisfied.,If someone from Netflix is reading this please lower your prices according to Indian standards. Their standard price is 500rs for a month. While they have an excellent catalogue of movies and originals some of them are even exceptional but I cancelled my subscription because it was burning a hole in my pocket. People go to Amazon prime instead which is more value for money. Other areas they need to excel is in customer service sometimes when I was in a situation I called them and the lines were always busy.   
Loved it!!,I have been using Netflix from an year.before that I used to use my cousin's Netflix.now me and my three friends got our own subscription.when it comes to quality and quantity it's the best one.i saw latest episodes of punisher. in the past I saw daredevil dexter 13 reasons why many more.Basically i'm a series addict.this is one is the best for the folks of my kind.   
More price for subscription,Hi friends I want to share about netflix.com design American entertainment company which was been founded by mark and this website is used for the watching movies and TV shows which of the provided by the netflix.com like stranger things and House of Cards these are the TV shows which are provided by the netflix.com and in this Netflix is there Prime subscription which cost of 500 rupees per month this is a huge price but I do not suppose this much of price.     the customer service is very reliable and that take care of their customers for any detail in the subscription of the netflix.com     the product quality of the netflix.com is good and the picture quality which was been provided by them was good with no disturbance because it is one of the famous International site     you can pick the price of certain shows videos which had been provided by them.     but the only problem is with the subscription price provided by them.   
Super site,It the only website where you can watch latest and top unlinked online streaming videos. its the most one of the largest online streaming videos website. you can explore the new trending series like strange thinga guns and thighs official the games of throns and many more latest videos. so you can have a lot of fun.   
Great selection but costly,I father enjoy the variety of films and television shows available on Netflix but I find the selection of childrens films isnt that great. They have also increased the price per screens which is quite unfortunate and costly.     I think that for the price of this product there should be more choices available for all audiences.   
BE CAREFUL BEFORE YOU SIGN UP NETFLIX,After retirement I activated an account with Netflix to watch movies. While activating an account I gave my credit card details. I used the account along with my wife for about 2 months. we dis not find good content of movies and therefore I wanted to cancel my account and remove my credit card details from the account. To my surprise I could not do this. I could just cancel my subscription but I could not cancel my account or remove my credit card details form the account. I contacted inline support . I was told that my account would be canceled. However the email received by me informed me as follows;     "We've changed your account email address as you asked. You will no longer be able to use shettyuc@outlook.com to sign in to Netflix; please use your new email address."     SO NOW I AM NOT SURE IF ALL MY DATA IS REMOVED FORM THE WEBSITE. TODAY WITH DATA SECURITY BEING IN QUESTION THIS BECOMES AN IMPORTANT ISSUE.'     SO BE CAREFUL WHEN YOU ACTIVATE AN ACCOUNT WITH NETFLIX.     OF COURSE I AM GOING TO TAKE THIS UP WITH REGULATORS:   
Netflix - replacement of tv,Netflix have taken taken place in the hearts very soon and the only reason is the contents they have. You have a large content to choose from they have great shows and movie to choos from. They have some great shows like russel peter virdas kevin harts what now and many more which are totally worth watching the second best part they have are the movie they have quite a good collection of bollywood as well as hollywood collection and the good thing about the app is everything is catagorised in a bery perfect way making it easy to choose what you really want to see netflix originals have a quality stuff to spend your spare time. The app provides you one month free and after that its 650 a month and I totally satisfied with ehat they charge because they provide stuff ehich is worth spending because you get the best value for your money.   
Netflix Indian version review,Hello friends this is lakahay and ill like to express my thoughts on the Netflix app which is available in india and wheather it is worth spending money on it.     So the Netflix app offers Great content. It has a large number of tv shows available and many hit bollywood movies are present.     It offers 1 month of free service and after it you have to pay 650 rs per month for it. It has a bunch of new good bollywood movies like Dangal Kaabil etc and many old  hit movies. It also offers the comedy show of vir das which Netflix is marketing aggressively.     The vir das comedy show is great. The app is install is worth the show alone. It has its own original Netflix series like 13 Reasons why narcos the house of cards etc. These series are very popular too.     But the with Netflix india is that all new seasons of these series are not available in the Indian version of the application.     For example I am a big fan of Narcos season 1 is available in the app but season 2 is not which is available in the American version. They are kind of discriminating with us pun intended.     The app experience is refined compared to Amazon prime video. But it is not worth 650rs for an Indian consumer every month.     You can watch every show with all seasons available on the websites for free.     Although you can enjoy the free trial and the vir das comedy show for a moth.     Thank you and pls hit a like     Do post your comments and questions in the comment section below   
Its a great product.I really appreciate yhe owner,Its a great product.once you buy it you never ever regret of it thats for sure.Truly amazing thing.once I was in the hospital admitted for around 35days or some more days and parents were probably not able to stay with.There it goes I ordered a series and my entire medical journey went away like 2 days ( more than one and half a month) .I liked the makers of series and the actors too.They just dont pretend but try to do the same as you say getting into the character or something     Moreover its great to try   
Netflix,I love Netflix . Just got a smart TV not to long ago . Have it on there also . Would like to see all seasons for some or all TV shows not just a few that are on here . . I really love netflix and it has been my primary source of entertainment only seconded to youtube . Love using netflix to watch shows that you can't get on cable . I can watch my movies on Netflix . Never buffers . LOVE IT . Use it while running on a treadmill . So much better than others apps . Thanks !   
Mobile theatre,It is the one of the worlds best online streaming app.     The qyakity of the apo is so good as compared to others.     You acn stream 24/7 any where any time at any corner of the world using your smartphine.     The seasons are really very good.     The seasons are original.     You can watch 1st in this app.     The feature of the app is very good.     Very good streaming.     The fees for this app is good.     Value for money     I personally use to watches new series.     Most popular app in America     I can rate this app 9 out of 10.   
Netflix,Netflix lets you stream films tv programs and box sets to your tv or cmputer. Theres a large list and some good titles but films dont get updated to often. The netflix original series are good and worth watching and is enjoyable television. The interface is good on the app and theres is not much buffering but that depends on your broad band speed. There is something for everyone on netflix and you usally get a months free trail then the monthly fee is around £7 that is pretty reasonable. All in all I would recommend getting netflix.   
Not worth for Subscription,Hi     Netflix is very costly and gives.very less variety of content most of them are very very old content which are shown in Latest release I tried 1 month free trial but paying 650 is not worth to pay  try other apps dont go for subscription waste of money.all old content nothing fresh but one thing is good it even runs on low speed net.   
Costly as compared to others,Netflix is video streaming services video on demand subscription based service from US. It has launched in India early this year. And I will share my experience with it. And will Consider it advantages or disadvantages with respect to other services available in India. Based on my experience I am not satisfied with their price policy etc. So I would tell what I don't like about it.     So its cons-     Price is not so much good as other very cheap as compared to this services are available right now.     It price range is     1 In Rs 500 monthly     one person can watch only @same time     not even hd content provided     2 In Rs 650 only hd content is available     Only two person can watch @same time     3 Rs 800 plan ultra hd is provided but not all content is present in ultra hd so its questionable to pay this much or not     Four person can watch @same time     So price are very much as many other service of around Rs50 is also available with just like same content     Also these people not even provide free one month trial without giving yours payment details.First you have to     provide your source of payment then they will give free on month trial that thing I disliked the most.     So you can think one is high price & other is no free trial even for a month.     Some pros -     Content is widely available & many new exclusive tv series available     Never slowed down its service thats good     But the price is more than adequate .Also many subscriptions services are available in cheap.So I will say it not good deal to go for it.     So overall seeing its pricing I will not recommend( Rs 650 per month for this service its costly than cable tv ) to anyone.Hence I will give just 2 stars out of 5.   
Lacks variety,They lack variety in content and is expensive as it charges 500 inr per month and lacks good Indian content. Whereas their competitors of Indian origin provide both Indian and western content in abundance at much cheaper rate. The only thing I like about Netflix is their smart TV support which is not available with other apps and for me watching whole movie and shows on a mobile is not as convenient as watching them on TV.   
Netflix or nothing!!,I love streaming the netflix at my time. I know for india its have limited contained. I don't know why. once I asked the services provider they said soon they will give the same content to all country. I'm using my aunt account whos in US. I've watch so many series like the 100 daredevil orange in the new black black mirror bates motel stranger things and many more. really I did enjoy a lot whatever they have but they don't have usa contain thats why I would like to give 4 star to this site   
Netflix,I am utilizing this site from the last month.To exploit this administration you will need to spend every month no less than 500 rupees. We are told about the imperative things Service.     Netflix is?and Why to subscribe .     This is an American spilling administration. 18 years after dispatch in the US could achieve India. It was propelled in India on Wednesday a week ago. At the same time the administration in all significant nations of the world aside from China which has given. The least expensive arrangement is Rs 500 month to month. In the event that you need to watch the HD content you extra Rs 150 or Rs 650 that would cost. The TV shows and films are accessible a great deal more assortment. Films are likewise accessible free at locales like the Torrance as well. Be that as it may Torrance is free however not legitimate. To download motion pictures on this framework can come in numerous risky infections and the danger of information burglary from the framework stays steady.   
Can't sign in any more,Hey everyone.     I loved the netflix app. But the recent updates have marred my experience. Firstly since about a month ago the chromecast support is broken.(And I used it a lot) Secondly the most recent update doesn't let me sign in anymore. Although I can sign in from a browser the app keeps reporting invalid password.:(     No problem signing into the website on the same device. Pointless waste of storage.     hope this review may help you     thanks for reading   
Does not Click With Me!,The popular streaming website Netflix launched in India more than 6 months ago. Known for its wide variety of content and its own series like House of Cards this streaming website has more than 90 million customers in over 100 countries including India. I was pretty much excited with its foray into the Indian market. However my excitement soon dissipated into air.     First of all since Netflix works through internet you need to have a solid broadband network. In fact if you want to subscribe for Ultra HD or 4K streaming you need to have a solid 4k television and an internet speed of around 100 mbps. Netflix itself advises vieweres to have an internet connection with a speed higher than 15Mb for a seamless streaming of 4k content. Adding to that you need to     The second issue is the variety of content. Netflix India has a narrower variety of content. In fact Netflix's most famous series House of Cards is not even available in India. Adding to that its Indian content too is pretty limited. Leaving aside few classic Bollywood movies and series there is very little it has to offer. I am not even talking about the regional Indian cinema here!     In conclusion Netflix is a good service if you want good American content. It has very limited Indian matter and frankly given the poor broadband services here in India it is likely that much of your time would be spend on waiting for the buffering to stop.   
Netflix focus on Hindi,I have been user of Netflix for more than 3 months. It is providing Good content for English Hindi and now Punjabi too.     It has a lot of good content for Kids. Pepa Teletubbies and Wiggles etc.     My favorite are English documentaries Netflix original series and hind movies.     If you are looking for Tamil titles and entertainment you would be disappointed.     Cost is too high at this moment. I hope they will make it more affordable so that many come on board.   
Good collection of movies and series,Netflix is a online streaming of movies and series website.It has started its services in india since last 3-4 months.     They are charging a fees of minimum 500 per month for its services after giving a month of subscription free.     Few features of Netflix which impressed me are as follows.        Video quality is very good. You can enjoy videos in normal quality or in HD or even in ultra HD depends upon its subscription fees.        Buffering is very fast.        If you stop a video at middle and again  open the same video after wards if resumes the video from the point where it was stopped or paused previously.        Sync very good between app and the website. Even if I pause or close a video in my laptop and open the same video in my mobile through app the video resumes from that point in app too.        A huge collection of movies and TV series.        Some great netflex original series like house of cards narcos daredevil and many others which you can watch directly in Netflix        Watch everything online so no need to fear virus or worm attack.           Through its has some great features I doubt this service would be successful in India as India is not much connected via broadband and mobile internet cost is high. And I don’t know if India is ready to pay a subscription fees of Rs 500 for its services.   
Finally in India,I also use to wonder why netflix is not India I think they heard me and finally netflix is in India.I love their service and its a great way to choose want you really want.     Unlike in India we need to watch show that are shown to us by cable tv operators which is always with the repeating movies and serials.Netflix is a place you need to subscribe to them and watch unlimited movies tv shows etc.     Netflix in India: I happy that netflix has come to indian audience to what I saw with the free subscription     I am using is that the collection of movies and tv shows are very limited.     I hope very soon they just provide all the data like full movies collection all the other features.   
Not cool for Indian,This site is not so cool for Indians.     As I heard about it that it entered in Indian market.     It has many shows and he movies which can be watched online. Its better than YouTube. But in India in present I has no market. Indian are not rich that they can afford Netflix.     Netflix is paid service. It cost 500 rupees per month. If in India YouTube is available then we didn't gonna pay to Netflix. These people are doing business only in India. And charges are too much for Indians.   
Good Service For Watching Movies,I am using this website from the last month.To take advantage of this service you will have to spend each month at least 500 rupees. We are told about the important things Service.     Netflix is?and Why to subscribe .     This is an American streaming service. 18 years after launch in the US could reach India. It was launched in India on Wednesday last week. Simultaneously the service in all major countries of the world except China which has provided.     The cheapest plan is Rs 500 monthly. If you want to watch the HD content you additional Rs 150 or Rs 650 that would cost.     The TV shows and movies are available much more variety. Movies are also available free at sites like the Torrance too. But Torrance is free but not legal. To download movies on this system can come in many dangerous viruses and the risk of data theft from the system remains constant.     How Subscribe     For the first month of the users is absolutely free. First you have to create their ID at Netflix. For this you Netflix website or Android iOS and Windows apps can use.     ID when you ask the credit or debit card information. Since the first month of service is free so there will deduct money from your account.   
Netflix now in India what is reality?,I just checked for Netflix on Mouthshut and it actually exists but it had two reviews written long time ago that too by US citizens about their experiences with it in the states. Now that they are slated to be launched in India I thought of giving here to the readers a glimpse of it.     Here it is in short what Netflix is all about and how it will impact us in India -     What is Netflix: Its an American company providing on-demand Internet streaming media. What it simply means is you can watch your favorite movies/TV shows simply on-demand over the internet. Netflix have a huge customer base in the US and some part of the world and have recently ventured into many other countries including India.  It offers movies and TV shows to be watched online and you can stream them on to your smart TV laptop mobiles etc.     How is it going to be in India? The service has been launched in India with subscription rate starting from about 500 a month with Ultra HD contents with which you can watch unlimited movies/TV shows. I understand there would be also a first month free trial period and the payment needs to happen via Credit card.     There will be a Netflix website on which most of their contents will be available for India but only few Bollywood options. As it grows they would be working on increasing the contents and even extending to regional languages.     However in India Netflix could possibly face several issues primarily related to  Censorship and others could be related to licencing cultural issues payment related and so on.     Now comes the important part - all of this looks quite attractive however all of this is possible with a high internet connectivity which is real pain in most part of the country. We are talking about streaming which means a movie can download about 3-4 GB data and hence it would need a good internet connection. (This could be a serious dampener in this whole concept).     Interestingly though Netflix has its presence in more than some 50 countries they don't operate in China (I am not sure of the reasons though).   
Customer service at netflix,Can only obtain regular net flix email addresses would love for everyone in management to be able to read about the type of customer service they really give and would love for all on internet to read about my experience:     I was very unhappy with customer service  I had an email that said to call customer service. Upon calling I was accused of fraudulent activity regarding the number of movies that I had reported being late arriving to you after I had mailed them.     I always wait the three days recommended and if I do not receive an email from net flix stating my movie had reached net flix.     Then I send in an email. I am not concerned with the number of times I do this but your policy states"after waiting 3 days contact net flix" which is what I do. If you will check my records I have never had a movie actually lost where it cost you a penny or that I had to pay for because it was lost also check out the total number of movies I have rented from you and the dollars spent.     It is a lot and I am a good customer with no other complaints NOT EVEN ONE about your services and I have convinced over a dozen of my friends to subscribe to your site. I am very unhappy about the "possible fraudelent activity concerning my account. I may even publish it on my movie club newletter and drop my subscription. It was very disturbing and upsetting considering that I was even asked not to report any more movies missing. Roy Mitchellp o box 1141 Andrews Texas 79714
