Amazon prime video... Worth for your money???,Amazon prime video is one of the best app/website to be purchased to watch movies online. For rupees 1000/- annually your can watch many movies and series online and it comes wits mwany benefits for eg- if you purchase prime your can get one day delivery on Amazon app and you can login to Amazon music with the same account.     For me I think its a good app/website to purchase for entertainment.   
We are getting many movies for just 129₹ pm,I I a user of this application and also have a monthly subscription.     I get a good service as it is very cheap just 129₹; pm so.     And I get to see many movies at that rate.   
Amazon Prime Video is it worth of purchase?,Hello guys I have used Amazon Prime for one year now so it is the right time to aware you all about its worth.     Price: If we talk about its price then you all know the annual subscription charges 999Rs. for Indian users now recently Amazon discontinued the one month plans so now one can purchase either 3 months or one year pack. For your information 3 months pack charges you 329 rs.     Services offered: Amazon Kindle by which you can read books but the point is in kindle you have to pay for books and also has its own subscription.     Free delivery: For prime products you need not to pay for shipping so if you order low value items then this app benefits you.     Amazon Prime video: Only Amazon Prime video is one of the features that I really like in this app. Recently on June 4 family man part 2 is going to be release on it. Overall I really like this one app.     Question arise whether it worth it or not. Yes it worth it go for it.   
Prime Video is Not Justified it's Subscription Fee,Brief     Amazon is one the World's biggest e-commerce company and do it's prime Video Streaming Platform justified it's Charge and Fee as Compared to Other Streaming Giants like Netflix and other in today's review we will be take a look of My Experience from Three Months Subscription of Amazon prime video.     Review     At the time of purchasing services from Amazon prime it provides so much offers and discounts which gives us feel like it is better than other streaming platform but when you start using it services you realise that it does not have that much of content that other platform provides in this range or with the little higher range Amazon prime video has outdated and old kind of contents of Bollywood English shows and all the animation movies and cartoons. User Experience is good but if doesn't have good content that all goes in vein finally it's Time for     conclusion     If You wanna to have good time and chill and have little more budget then go for Netflix it have more and enjoyable content .     If you have Less budget and you didn't know about the level of Webseries then you must prefer Prime Video with great discount .     Stay safe Stay Indoors     Peace.   
Detecting videos.,The home page floods the user with Indian regional language movies notwithstanding the fact that he chooses English as his choice of movies. It needs a filter to display only what the user wants.     There is a lot of teasing:a number of videos are advertised but when I clicked on them they said video unavailable. If Prime is not providing videos don't display them.     There is a limitation in the Seasons of some videos featured without explanation nor consideration which frustrates the subscriber. For example: the Serial "the Good Fight." If it can't provide the entire Series don't feature anything at all.     The navigation is bad.... There are a huge number of videos that come up only by clicking and clicking. Prime needs to improve its navigation methodology.   
Amazon Prime Video | Review | Bad content,Streaming Site - Amazon Prime video     Amazon prime is a streaming site that provides you new exclusive movie series Anime. It is an American subscription video on demand over the top rental service of Amazon.com.     It gives you 30 days of the free trial Rs129/Month & Rs 999/ Year. The shows are pretty good & they did some Fairless job like the Tandav web series which attack the bad site of Indian modern society. But after the release Amazon's prime officials are afraid of the bad people of the community and forced the makers of the Tandav to remove the scene from the Tandav Web series. I am so disappointed at that time.     Also they have a prime video app for android users. When I see any movies or something in this app sometimes the quality of the video went down and when I want to connect with my TV they showed an error. And they have not too much good Indian content. So I cancel my subscription after watching Mirzapur 3.     Thank you for reading this review.     Please like this review.   
Amazon prime review,Amazon prime video Platform is very good and quality full website or app .i am sure that is vety good video entertainment website and app . Thank you   
Best OTT platform,I bought Amazon prime for 1 year at 999 and get 500 rupees as a cashback.     Prime provides Best movies and webseries on their platform.     There is no such buffering problem.     Everything are fine their.     With amazon prime service I also get free and fast delivery service and early acces to the best Deals.   
Average,I have a 3 month prime membership  if you ask for prime video then I will describe it point wise -     Quality of video - video quality is good if you have better internet connection  it's totally depend on network.     Entertainment - you will not get each video in this site you will only get that  which is uploaded by Amazon and you will get some best movies.     Money - it's not very expensive to to get membership some other can also get benefits from using your id.     So  it is not so good to use but it is average.   
Best Video Streaming App,Amazon Prime Video helped me to spend Quarantine period quite easily. Series like Mirzapur Made in Heaven Paatal Lok makes it better video streaming app as compared to other apps. 'Shakuntla Devi ' movie which is streaming on Amazon Prime Video has got great reviews. Series like Made in Heaven Paatal Lok Mirzapur make people stick to this app. Video quality is quite impressive. There is no monotony when it comes to the concepts. There are some of the movies or series which can been seen with the family. It is definitely worth the money.   
Day I was been cheated with a loss of 28 Dollars.,So I being a rational consumer on Amazon loves to surf this site very much. This incident took place in the year of 2018. So like any other day I was surfing on Amazon like usual and I come across the Amazon prime service available in India I liked the services they provided and that time there were was a 30 days trial period so thought to cancel the membership on the last day of the trial. I took the trail and cancelled it on the last day. then I come across the US amazon prime membership and there was a bit more services available on that us site. I mistakenly buy that service and forget that I purchased it on us site. so after 1 month I get y credit card receipt and there I was been charged of$7 on it as an international transaction. I got surprised and quickly gone to the website but I found that there was no prime membership running on my account.i fell that my credit credit card got hacked. And continuously for two they charged$7. finally I came across the us site and found that the prime service is running in that us site and till that time I have not used a bit it.i immediately cancelled it and as per the policy I should get a refund if I did not used the service much.but they did not refund my money. I don't know if this is because I was a Indian amazon customer and applied for the us site but atleast they should refund 50% of money. this was my story so beware of this next time you take any prime membership.   
Blurry video streaming,After many days I subscribed to amazon prime videos to see breathe into the shadows but I found out the video streaming blurry so I thought might be some network issue but when I streamed on youtube on the same connection  the hd video was running smoothly on youtube. So I checked the display settings and I was already in best display mode and I cleaned the junk files and restarted device and tried to check another webseries unforgotten army and display was even more blurry so I tried to wait for 15 minutes but it was going good for a while and again it blurred again and again. It really needs improvements in interface keeping in mind the quality standards of netflix and hotstar   
Honest review Love the app,Amazon Prime     Hello everyone.     I will be sharing my opinions and review on a very addictive and interesting app that's used by millions that Amazon Prime Video.     I am a user of the Amazon Prime for almost 2 years and its worth the price. It's easily available on play store and the app store so yoy\u can easily download from the store sign in with your account and you are ready to go. The membership cost around 999/- yearly or 129/-     monthly. There is an offer available for students where they can get 500/- cashback on the yearly membership.     The app provides various features in one-day delivery options as well as free delivery a streaming platform which gives movies and TV series in various languages and an Amazon music app which also is very good.     Latest movies and TV shows are available early.     The price for which it offers so many things is just awesome. overall the prime users get access to the amazon sale early and more amazon pay offers are available for the prime users.     Very nice app and must recommend using.   
Amazon prime video 30 day trial don't go 4 it.,Please don't go 4 it. After one or two movie show prime will ask u bank card details & shows warning that if u don't cancel it it will auto renew by Rs.999 per year. So without giving bank card detail u will not able 2 enjoy 30 day free trial. Once u fill up bank card detail & 4get to cancel u will charged Rs.999/-. So beware of getting fooled. It's risky trial.   
Poor service is provided.,Prime video also know as amazon prime video is an internet-based video-on-demand service.     It is owned by Amazon whose CEO is Jeff Bezos.     Prime video offers many exclusive shows and series and besides that it offers many movies     Pros     -Exclusive series     -Exclusive and original content     -Support of music and free prime delivery benefits     -low cost in comparison to Netflix     Cons     -Paid service No free content     -Many movies are missing     -Lack of good series as Netflix     -Not all products on amazon are prime supported     -Too much buffering while streaming     Web app design     The amazon prime app has been designed very badly it don't work properly in Smart Tv the app has a confusing system that should work on app development. The amazon prime just works fine on laptops or pc which have bigger screen and chrome support. Their developer team needs to work on it and also make more or every product prime labeled.     My personal experience     My personal experience with amazon prime has been not very good It often crashes on its own. Yes you can hare the passwords with many others and relatives but it has an error while chrome casting     Secondly its interface is not very good in comparison to Netflix and The amazon prime app on smart Tv works worst.     You cant properly connect your phone to television and the app functions also do not work properly on the television app the fast forward buttons are very confusing.     Conclusion-     Concluding my review I want to say don't waste your money in buying the prime or it will just work fine on your laptops or pc and nowhere else. Else you could google some tricks to download the series and another thing for free of cost it will save your money and time both     I hope you like my review if you like it do follow me for more.

About Amazon prime video,I am sharing my personal experience towords Amazon prime. Last time I got Amazon free trial and it was super awesome. In this portal they provide daily updates movie. When I compare Netflix to Amazon prime so I think amzon prime is better then Netflix because in the Netflix all the about criminal. In Amazon prime video there are family movie are there that's way it's sufficient for a family.     Why only Amazon prime video.     There are some reason which I got know that     Customer service best they provide.     Easy to use interface.     There is less lacking of the system.     Family friendly.   
Insufficient bandwidth error messages on my tv,I got "Insufficient Bandwidth" message. But other videos on Netflix YouTube etc. are working just perfectly fine. It is so boarring to watch my loved movies on a fhd tv with this type of error messages and picture blur  what kind of technology you are using make it supportive for all operating system as well as with least requirements alike YouTube Netflix etc... So saaaaad.   
One of the best video streaming service!,Amazon prime is one the most popular streaming service in India. It is a platform where you can stream and watch movies and web series. Below are some of the reasons for which I would recommend amazon prime over other streaming platforms:        Video and Audio quality on amazon prime is the best in it’s class.        The UI ( User Interface) of the app is amazing and user friendly.        The movies and web series are available in most of the languages spoken in India.        The subscription price ofcourse. It costs only Rs. 999 per year which doesn’t hurt the pocket of a middle class man. For students it's just Rs. 500 per year n that's really amazing           Also amazon prime releases some of the stuff of it’s own as well which is only available on prime.     One such example is Four more shots please.     I personally have watched many movies such as Crazy rich asians Good newwz and web series such as Two and a half men The office Mom Vampire Diaries and would recommend each one of you reading my review to buy the subscription and enjoy streaming movies and web series in the best quality available on the internet.   
Dear costumer don’t get amezon prime Videos.,Dear all don’t prefer and get amezon prime log in. They are cheating us various methods. If you are share your video Chrom cast means it will not connect  if in case connect it will automatically close with in

REALLY UNHAPPY WITH AMAZON PRIME SUPPORT,I have the Prime Amazon Membership and for almost 15 days I am not able to stream any videos on my One Plus 7. I have called the customer support 4 times explaining the issue every time and the funniest thing every time every support team member gives different reasons for the issue.     " Can I place your call on hold to check the issue" "Thank you for your patience Maam" 'We are really very sorry" "We can't commit on the time when the issue will be resolved".     I have heard this over and over in all the calls.     I really don't understand if there is a technical issue of video not streaming on One Plus 7 how is the issue not resolved and why is it taking so long. I think it's a big-ticket to the backend team.     I really have no idea how long I need to wait for this issue to get resolved.     In my last call I wanted a call back from the higher authorities but I never got any callback.     I have paid for the subscription and I need a solution for it.     How long do I need to wait for it?     I am only left with no other option then write reviews everywhere.     I wonder if this is going to really affect you.   
Amazon.com Fraud,ICICI has a tie up with Amazon Prime If you tend to purchase any Product through Amazon.com then Amazon Prime gets enabled automatically and the money starts getting detected from the Debit card every month.(Loss of 1900 RS in two month's time). Post unsubscribing from Amazon Prime and removing the ICICI account details in Amazon.com website with in a few days the money was stolen through VINLINKEDIN with a loss of around 1600rs. Realized the account was miss used by ICICI or Amazon or by some one who is linked to either of these two organizations. I have now closed the ICICI Account. Be Cautious with these Org's.

Very disappointed,Amazon Prime becoming such a Bullshitt right now. Only they are uploading movie in South Indian language. Looks like it's only South Indian app. Disgusting. U guys uploaded sahoo and syeraa in South Indian language only. Such a shame   
Prime is a pet of South content,Prime has become a pet of Tamil telgu mallu and Kannada movies.. like rest of India doesn't exist. No latest English or Hindi content. All Hindi series comes once in a while but other Indian language content is so fuking frequent.   
Nice Interface but lack of movies,Hello everyone! Amazon Prime Video is a streaming service which provides movies and web series. I am sharing some pros and cons of Amazon Prime Video.     Pros:     Nice user interface and user-friendly.     Available at a low cost.     Many devices can be connected by using only one account.     Different streaming quality options are available so as to avoid high data usage.     Subtitles are available for almost all movies.     Cons:     Lack of movies and very limited web series are available.     Very less movies are available in multiple languages.   
Great Video Streaming Platform,Hello Everyone.!     Amazon Prime Video is an online Video Streaming platform where users can watch Various Tv-Series Movies Animated Videos etc.     Amazon Prime video is available in Website as well as on Mobile Application. And the best thing about it is that it is affordable by everyone i.e 999/Year. We can find Hollywood Bollywood and South Indian Movies here. Movies here are available in various languages like Hindi English Tamil etc. There are many Tv series that we can't find easily on Internet but most probably you can get it on Amazon Prime Video. I have been using amazon prime for 1 Year and I really loved its services. The only thing I didn't liked about amazon is its search option Search option doesn't Work Properly but may be amazon will fix it Soon.     Thank You   
Amazon prime,Hi I am Amazon prime member my e-mail I'd has been changed because I have forgotten my password and unable to login to prime video as well kindly help me to login

Amazon prime :No entertaining,Hello guys today I am going to review about amazon prime vedio which I am using it from past 1 year.     Guys I am a prime member of amazon from 1 year and I am paying 130 rupees every month and guys I didnt found that much entertaining concepts from amazon such that whatever movies and serials you are getting they all available in telegram for free     Some of the programms which are not found in amazon are also available in telegram     And guys amazon prime donot have more regional movies and amazon keeps on removing movies     And sometime I gets stuck by vedio quality     and whatever regional movies are available those all are old one and guys as I see more kannda movie only one new kannada movie that I found is kgf     So guy s I prefer not to subscribe it   
Useless,Amazon keep deleting movies it doesnt has any new movies     all movies are there which you have watched     its not worth the money   
Most useless and pathetic one,I have seen one pop up about this worst amazon prime and interested to opt it and onfact my friend too using it and but suggested not to opt it ?????????? but I went ahead and taken it first I thought per month later went to year subscription and now my rral problems started. firat of all Amazon prime app is so worst and buffering buffering pathetic than youtube. pic quality is trash even in top class. what a pathetic quality amazon prime. waste amd. Worst amazon prime   
Amazon prime audio,Amazon prime..The audio is very feeble whereas background track is loud..unable t listen even at high volume.Im using samsung android tab. Same prblm with others when contacted. Screen mirroring with tv does not show any improvement.     I dont know how the amazon stick works   
Amazon Prime Video,Dear Friends I was subscribe Amazon Primes for me and family members. it is really enjoy family full day of a week. I and my Family members are really satisfied with services and functionality provided by company endless. Really Good and Effective Service. I recommended to subscribe and Enjoy your life.   
Use Less...,Amazon Prime Video is useless because new movies are not coming on time. They are uploading movies 8 to 9 months after the release date.     I will never suggest to anyone for Prime Membership.     better we will go with any other option this is the worst membership.   
Not prime,I don't feel prime as we get in shopping for delivery all the movies uploaded very late almost same time when it comes on TV itself. Not many TV web series like we have in other prime channel memberships difficulty in browsing the contents it's mixed and not useful search result also don't work in some cases. Even this don't have casting to TV option I mean the player has limilited functions.     There must be some more category to be added in this.   
About contain they provide,Amazon prime video is a very good application in terms of contain and video they have     I subscribe amezon prime members since 1 year.     They give a best serious to watch lick merzapur and other English series for watch.     They provide various movie also for watch and also have access of subtitles.     It's pleasure to watch contain in oue language and with English subtitles they provide.     With subtitles I can improve my learning with English and also learn a new word.     Subscription is the velue for money.     .     And also I can download the contain offline for letters watch with subtitles and the best thing is they provide information about acters which are in video so I can improve my knowledge regarding the acter also .   
Amazing Source of Entertainment in India,Amazon prime is a yearly subscription . It include amazon fast delivery and other extra features of products. In addition amazon prime video can be accessed through prime subscription. In amazon prime video app one can be accessed with multiple tv series its own series' etc. In India amazon prime video include kids series also. Most famous series' are very much related to India and we love to see it.   
Limited Movie Database,Amazon Prime benefits are good. Videos Shopping and Music in one subscription and at a reasonable price. I am a movie lover and wanted to watch movies in all languages. Movie database isn't that good. new movies will be added rarely. I have watched a few series like Young Sheldon Jack Ryan Breath The Mentalist and Mirzapur. these are good to watch.   
Honest review,I am using amazon prime video since 3 months. Amazon prime India region sucks to be honest nothing is valuable here except Mirzapur series. All old or not worth to watch movies. Its better to go for netflix or try watching movies online than spending money here.     Imrpovement - Needed alot try uploading good english series and latest good movies.   
You get what you pay for.,Ive been subscribed to amazon prime for 2 years now.Infact i only use amazon prime as my whole source of entertainment.I dont have cable connection either.It is defenitely a good series/movies viewint platform but not as good as netflix.Anyways we only pay around 900 for an whole year whereas other things like netflix charges us 599 per month.Amazon prime is sefenitely a vfm product but can defenitely not be dependent as a single source of entertainment.in Tamil i feel like they mostly buy very boring movies.They usually never get hit movies from not only tamil but from any indian language if money is not an issue for you go for netflix if not amazon is goot too but not the best.   
Superb video experience,Hello guys     I would like to share my experience on Amazon Prime video.     recently I subscribe Amazon Prime video and watched to series 1 is breath and 2nd is Mirzapur.     both series are very good and entertaining.     it also provides latest new movie directly on amazon prime. that is good features of prime.     we can also download all the video and make it offline when you are out of network area.   
Amazon Prime videos,Hi there is no latest movies in this the only movies which are utter flop movies will upload first that is the good thing of amazon I took one year subscription of prime it is waste of money no movies r good new movies which are even given on TV channels also not even getting in amazon so what is the use of prime video.   
Amazon Prime subscription,Hello All     Amazon prime is a amazing video browser. I have subscribed this network just on a trail base. Amazon has N number of TV series(the old one which we miss) and also different movies including Indian Movies. I have subscribed for the amout of 129Rs for 1 month pack and I am happy it is more than it is worth. Also like to mention they do have kids section where they can watch all fair tail and also TV programs. I would strongly recommend you to subscribe Amazon Prime Videos.   
Worth every penny,I am a active subscriber of prime video from past 5 months. Its been a great journey so far. The main thing I like about prime video is that it has lot of Indian content. Which make prime video more Indian. Prime video brings all new content with night quality resolution. Comics are best and is still rapidly expanding its collection. Long way to go with prime video   
#Review #29# Best entertainment app,Hi friends I want to share some the best entertaining app Amazon prime which bas contain lots of stuff who can easily entertain you. I personally used this app in my smart TV and I really enjoyed very much. Some my favorite web series also there and also new one which I like most. To be very honest I didn' t pay for Amazon prime because it' s a gift of free one year subscription from airtel portability and I must say when I experience it I very much entertain my self and after that I madly ues this app. I am sure that if its continuing uploading this kind a stuff then everybody will entertained there selfs. And also one thing in bounce that you can using your prime membership for anything order from Amazon.com in less time and betting way that I like very much. I also ordered from Amazon.com using prime membership and I found good results so that I want that everybody use this and take benefit. See friends I am not promoting some thing but its good so that I can share with you. Thank you friends for giving me your time.   
One Stop for Many Genres,I am really happy that Amazon have launched such a great Video collection platform.     They have movies cartoons tv-serials animations etc. That too in English Hindi Telugu Tamil Marathi and Bengali.     I have watched a lot off movies tv-serials from Amazon Prime Video.     The perk is that they are official streaming partners of all the latest movies most of them appear in the Amazon prime Video within a month of the theatrical release.     They have this x-ray feature where you get to know about the characters present in the current scene and the name of the background music playing. They even have the IMDB rating which helps you to choose the best to watch.     Not to forget they even have their oven Amazon Originals shows which recently had comicstaan which was a great stand-up comedy reality show by the way.     I connect my laptop to our TV and enjoy a movie with my family streaming from Amazon Prime Video occasionally.     Overall it is the best.   
Good picture quality & need some improvement.,Amazon prime video the quality of the most video is good     There is no latest videos. The video are more than 1 month old     Please upload latest videos .one more thing there are not all Bollywood movies I was searching for udta Punjab but this movie is not available on Amazon prime videos     Please make some improvement in your aap   
Real Hd Clarity,Hi     After continuous advertisement I have subscribed for Amazon Prime and I am loving it. All the movies shows are in HD clarity and the subscription price is also moderate not too high or low suitable for all groups. The first movies I have watched after the subscription is Rangasthalam Telugu movie of my favorite hero Ramcharan.     The concept of Amazon is great and the website well designed with clear segregation. The important thing which attracted the most is kids zone where my kids can enjoy their shows and movies.   
Amazon Prime Video,I tried the Amazon Prime one month free trial and I was sticked to the mobile. I am seeing usually the English TV shows this application have lot of English TV shows available just for Rs. 499/- per month. This is a version of Netflix and it is very pleasant.     Amazon prime can be easily download from Google Play Store and you can sync if with your amazon shopping app. So it takes all the login information from there. There's a quick tour of app when you first install and start using it.     The app is very easy to understand and it has a huge library of good movies and TV shows Amazon prime has some Prime exclusive shows too.     This app is an absolute delight and given the fact the quality is changeableas per your WiFi/Data sing skills are awesome.     I am very happy with Amazon prime.     Thanks.   
Best online movie app,The amazon has launched a nice concept on online movie for the prime members of amazon which had made them more profitable and attractive to others. I am a prime member of the app since it was lanched. I have got to see all the latest movies and tv shows on this app. the latest movies of best hd quality can be seen and also freely downloaded with less consumption of data. the facility is such given that you can even know the real name and their information of an character in ongoing video simultanousely. if also provides parential control on movie we watch. the movies are sorted according to comedy thriller action romance an kids. I hope that it will continue this facility and bring more and more update.   
Amazone prime,Don’t wast your time to search any Bollywood movies on Amazone Prime.     I am really disappointed with amazone prime no one is movies available on Prime. Online Google Website is much better then Prime.     Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo   
Great,I use to watch only amazon prime .latest movies and series .its really wonderful .high defination quality .you just need to pay 1000rs for yearly subscribe .after amazon prime I am not using cable tv .amazon prime has best quality of videos  yon can watch old films  english movies  web series .or either new films .its really in very less amount .but you need just internet connection at your place   
Super cheap and Super trash,Only thing about this website that amazes me is that it is super cheap. It has to offer loads of prime products at very cheap rate at 1000 Rs per annum. It also has started another offer which monthly offers 129 Rs membership.     The shows are super trash and hardly make an impact on the mind of the viewers. Breathe was an exception. It was very dark and pacy.     But overall it can't match the intensity or the quality that Netflix or Hulu has to offer.     Safe to say it is an average start by Amazon in the field of entertainment. Hopefully it will get better.   
Best video streaming service at this price,I am rarely impressed with the video streaming services available these days. Either they are too pricey or offer content that lacks quality. With Amazon Prime Video you can expect good quality at reasonable rate. Best part: You can share the membership with your friend to further reduce the price.     They regularly add new Bollywood movies to the catalog.     Currently I am enjoying their original show Comicstaan a reality series based on stand up comedy.

It's not really good app,Hi guys know I am introducing you to Amazon Prime video Amazon says that every type of videos and movie is there in app it's right but when we select any movie to see it we will type in into but so many times there is no response in our type. One more thing then we search any movie or any song we will not find a right movie or song from this app I would like just see you this app is not correct app to see any movie and video for online more better app are found in our smartphone . So I would like just say you use another web to see any video in any movie thank you guys ok bye have a nice day and hope in my comment in Amazon Prime video. ?   
Feel privileged,The Prime Video is like Netflix right? In fact somewhat less than Netflix because the collection is smaller. But it's still a good collection with something for everyone. Plus there's free music for your unlimited listening pleasure. The best thing about subscribing to Prime Video however is that you become an Amazon privileged customer. That means you get free and quick delivery on your purchases. The flip side however is that the free and fast delivery is not for every product - only those enlisted in Prime. Moreover the "fast" is not so fast anymore. Amazon needs to step up a gear to beat competition a.ka. Netflix.   
High quality videos,Friends today I would like to share my personal experience with the wonderful application amazon prime video.This application allow us to watch many tv shows and movies pragrammes series etc through this platform.First of all we want to pay 999 rs for one year.After that we can watch any tv shows and movies freely from here.The money we are paying is completely worth because the quality of videos are that much good and many movies and tv programmes that are not available in internet is available here.When we consider the monthly charge of cable and dish box this application is very cheap completely suitable for common people also.Even if we pay money more than this in cable and dish connection many shows are not available also we forced to watch in the time of telecast otherwise ee will miss that.But through this wonderful application after paying the certain amount we can watch every programmes in our free time.we will not miss any parts and dialogues.After the membership we can connect with multiple device and unlimited access are available.We can download videos here and watch offline.The data usage of the application is also very less.The other important feature is there is no any advertisments in this application.Channels are family friendly because there are channels for everyone.We can connect the amazon prime upto 3 devices.Many regional movies are also available which are not uploaded in any other platforms of internet.Latest shows can easily access from here.We dont want to spend more time in internet.Also the application interface is also very simple and the layout and design are very attractive and helpful for the easy usage.So if you are a person who loves watching tv shows then I reccomend you amazon prime video because it's just a great experience.   
Prime Videos: honest and through review,Prime Videos: After using it for an year and watching more the 50 TV series and 5-8 movies I'd say that it's worth it for 500/- Rs a year. There are some great tv shows are there like Mozart in a jungle American gods etc. They've put some famous tv shows too from other platforms like ABC Netflix etc.Movies section however is not even satisfying. They've got old boring and very selected or cheap ones in the collection. Overall as it is getting better with each day and quite cheaper than others I'd call it a go.   
Amazon Prime "Premium",I am using the amazon prime from couple of weeks.     Quality: First I want to tell about this quality it is really awesome.     Price: No other things will come on this reasonable price. Price wise I have satisfied well.     Tenure: They are giving one year on reasonable price. Compare with Netflix it is Superb.     Updates of Movies: I am not able to give the answer for this one. Because they are not updating frequently movies in this website. So I am little bit disappointed under this tab.     Netflix is awesome to updating a new movies in their website.     So finally my thought about this product is Good at reasonable price and giving long Tenure comparing with others like Netflix.   
Amazon Prime - Plz do not go for subscription,I am very disappointed after opting amazon prime membership at the cost of 999 that is too much costly .  as they have limited collection of movies videos and web series. whenever I try to search my favorite movie/videos it shows "YOUR SEARCH IS NOT FOUND" however these movies/videos are available on you tube Airtel and JIO TV app which are free of cost. it seems I wasted my money on amazon prime. also Amazon prime uploads the movies when they get outdated Overall I wouldn't recommend Amazon Prime - it is not up to the expectations.     Thanks

Excitement Videos - Amazon Prime Videos,I Personally Recommend this Amazon Prime Video Because the app is really good. Recent & New Movies you can watch it in HD. And all type of series also we can watch through this. In this app ads are not much. When I started watching it it was Exciting to watch more and more videos   
Worst movie and series app,Hello! I am using Amazon prime since last two month and I have tried to search many Hollywood movies & bollywood there but they have very limited collection It looks like I wasted my money. They dont have updated seasons of series and not even the best movies of all time All I can see is the few movies only with very limited choice or I should say there is nothing to choose as they dont have anything major to showcase.     Poor app ever

Amazon prime video review.,I tried the Amazon Prime one month free trial and I was hook up to it core. I am usually the English TV series person and this app has a lot of English TV series available for just rupees 4.99 per month. This is a version of Netflix and is very pleasant.     Amazon Prime can be easily downloaded from Google Play Store and you can sync it with your Amazon shopping app so it takes all login information from there comma there quick tour of the app when you first install it and start using it.     The app is very easy to understand and it has a huge library of good movies and TV series Amazon Prime has some Prime exclusive series 2 which are worth a watch.     There are many features on Amazon Prime video app which are comma the new arrival and best collection on the top if you have started using Prime it then has the watch next tab tab which will have the ongoing Osteen movies TV series this is some real good collection of prime original series this will have the latest movies in the Amazon Prime collection this has the collection of TV series that are in the library I am currently watching mum and believe me a review is up for the TV series.     This app is an absolute delight and given the fact that the quality is changeable as per your Wi-Fi or data saving skills are awesome.     Thank you.   
Won't get cheapest subscription anywhere else,I use my friends subscription and I am very much satisfied with the quality of services it offers for 2 devices.     The latest Bollywood movies are there and are in an Hd quality with subtitles like Padmavat and Tumahari Sulu.     Amazon Prime has also latest TV shows which are also its originals and have a very high IMDB rating.     The best part about it is that it has all the latest movies and TV shows and it is available at a very low price for a year as compared to Netflix.     You can also download and save later for watching it.     Its app is also quite smooth. Would highly recommend to people who have good wifi internet speed.     For college students and working people it's a great subscription along amazon offers.   
Amazon prime,Hey guys I have subscribed to Amazon prime 2months ago im telling u it is really amazing app . We can many webseries movies and all. Video Quality is very good. Customer service response is very good. I prefer it is very good app for entertainment.   
Amzon prime video review,Amazon with its prime membership. Here I'm sharing my review and experience with amazon prime membership. I'm became prime member in 2017 because of its different services. One of its service is amazon prime video. It contains many movies Tv shows and Amazon orginal series. Here also has kids section includes movies and tv serials. I can download my favourite movies tv series. Here I can choose quality as required by me. Over all good experience with the Amzon prime video.I hope this will helpful for you.     Thank you   
My honest review on 'Amazon Prime Video',Hello Buddies!     I subscribed to Amazon prime video a month ago after receiving 30 days free trial from them. Now I am relishing the opportunity to experience amazon prime video after subscribing to the prime membership.     There are a lot of different content on this app and the contents are also updated periodically. I use Amazon Prime Video especially for watching Bollywood movies. It gives us a hassle-free source of entertainment. My sister also adores watching cartoon movies there.     Giving one-month free trial to every user is a great feature we can give it a try without spending a penny. The quality of the video is always superb as different sorts of resolution are available here ranging from 144p to 1080p. If you have a sluggish network connection then you can enjoy the videos at low resolution.     The option to prefer the quality according to your data plan and speed is a great pleasure to have while watching your favorite shows.There is also an auto mode there which switches the resolution according to your internet speed.     You can follow all your shows online or you can download it and can relish anytime. There are many interesting web series newly released movies comedy shows and a lot more. This gives a flawless delight to our family.     The announcement of new shows or web series will be notified to you through the app. I subscribed to the Amazon Prime membership by spending less than Rs 500.     The app works smartly on any smartphone and doesn't take much ram and storage as it is less than 20Mb. You are also eligible to get free delivery of different products from Amazon website after subscribing for the prime membership as 'Amazon prime video' is a part of the leading online shopping store 'Amazon'. Amazon prime video is accessible on the website and android app too.     I am a happy and satisfied Prime member and hope the same for you people.     Thank you!     : )   
Unsatisfied membership,I have just bought membership of amazon prime and they disappointed me they said that the delivery of the produt I bought will be done by 2 to 3 days I orderd rhe product on tuesday and recieved it 6days later and I also questioned them they replied you are not premium member of amazon prime so I questioned them again and they said that product was delayed by the delivery companyNot any way satisfied by amazon prime     LIKE IF U AGREE : )   
Amazon prime video - my thoughts,Amazon prime video is a collection of movies tv shows and exclusive reality shows by amazon.     it is VOD(video on demand) type website where you can watch your favorite video from anywhere anytime.     it has very good collection of movies and tv shows.     you can watch all this content by paying Rs.999 per year.     it is better than Netflix.(According to my use)   
Love watching in Amazon Prime Video.,Amazon provided best offer that we can pay 999 rupees and access the movies tv shows Amazon original series in different devices irrespective of their location. Apart from that amazon now offering sponsership for movies and they will upload the latest movies in Amazon prime video within 20 days after the movie released. It has a awesome user interface. If we open the Amazon prime from the browser from our pc it will open in protected window so that no one can neither record the videos nor take the screenshot of login details.I think this application is one of the best at this cost when compared to netflix.   
Need some major improvements!,I m writing this review after having watched many movies on amazon prime video.and one thing I can definitely say that 'It lacks the experience' that you would expect from amazon.It has a collection of movies but they are not upto the mark and also the video quality is really avaerage even after viewing at 1080 full hd quality.that prime video player is not worth watching a video on!  really.I like hollywood movies vey much but whenver I try to find my favourite movie then always they are available in only english and that too doen not have a good print as well.Many movies have option to watch in hindi but most of them doesn't.so you would not enjoy it that much.I can definitely ignore it and so you too should ignore it.Thanks.   
Amazon,I have taken amazon prime video subcription for 1 year. but I did not find any way to use it because the movies I found in prime video are old movies that I can watch free online over the internet. no doubt it is very good in quality but in today generation peoples wants to see new movies and prime video take too much time to upload a movie from the releasing date of the same as you can see in picture ( latest movies on 6 of march 2018)  overall its good but they need upgrade themself according to their customer needs   
Not much content,I just used this service for a few days before switching to netflix and enjoying that more. Amazon prime video sure charges less than netflix in one year but the content provided is very disappointing . It has movies and episodes of famous tv shows but these tv shows and movies are available for free on hungama and vodafone or airtel mobile tv. Why should I pay for watching the content which I can enjoy for free. I want to pay to watch something different and exciting .     I use netflix which has a variety of content from all over the world and also has all the amazon prime content available there too. Sure thing that netflix charges about 12 times what amazon prime charges but they deliver excellent quality content which never disappoints . I have famous web series on this platform more than I could ever even find on Amazon prime.     Overall I would'nt recommend amazon prime video because paying for this service is just useless  you won't like the content and just waste your money on old and boring content. What you should consider is netflix or any other video streaming service famous in your area.   
Cheap and best,Amzon prime video is a very good platform offered by amazon to watch movies old tv shows documentaries and amazon exclusive's it only costs 999 INR per year which is damn cheap for the advantages amazon prime is offering.     The amazon prime video app also offers to download a minimum of 25 video shows which can be viewed later offline also many interesting categories to choose from comedy action and even kids.     Iverall I would recommend anyone who really want vakue for money to amazon prime and also lots of entertainment.   
Amazing,Hello friends now I want to share my review on amazon prime video . one of my friend recommend to me this app and I use this app by his id . this app charge 1000/ year . it has videos of latest movies tv shows . you can see on this app latest movies but it provide only particular movies and it has every type of language movie and it has English tv show also . there movies divided in so many categories like family movies latest movies kids moves drama movies . Bollywood movies Hollywood movies and comedy movies .there is also available tv shows like that type of categories . so enjoy prime videos.   
Superb quality easily access........,Hello Guys today I am gonna share my review on amazon prime video which I used since 1 month and I must say I fall in love with using Amazon prime video.     Amazon prime video is easy way to access video and see it from wherever you want and whenever you want.All you have with you is your smart phone and Amazon prime video subscription that's it.Quality of video of watching in this very good and best part of it we see video according to us not or in a spare time.     Guys if you also wanna to get experience of watching good quality and easily accessible video then switch using Amazon prime video.   
Cheap yearly subscription.,I love amazon prime video in india. Where netflix cost starting 499 to 800 monthly but amazon prime is 499 a year and lots of latest deshi released. Some of the best tv shows are available here. Thanks to amazon prime I watched som great bengali and south movies which I never heard of so for deshi lover this the the best online platform to indian to watch. And i'm a big fans of top gear now they producing the the the grand tour which is good plus point to take subscription. Amazon did reallg good jobs in indian market.   
Good application,Hii friends this application is good to see your favourite tv shoes and movies but there are no latest movies and one issue I found with it that if anyone wants free tv shows streaming it always asks for registration and ask for money so I prefer you to watch tv shows on youtube rather than this app recently I haved watched 5 shoes and it asked me for registration I deleted it from my phone got very angry   
Not satisfied,Subscribed a month back at Rs. 999 for a year purchased along with Amazon Fire Stick. Reading the reviews I thought it was a good deal. Disappointed as the movies are very     Very limited both English as well as Hindi. Few Tamil& telegu movies available. The reviews mentioning that there is a huge movie library is false. Quality of movies is good though option to chose HD or lesser to save data available.   
Quality Content - "I am in love",Since I have bought amazon prime video subscription I am in love with this. Earlier I used to have Netflix and Youtube red subscription while Netflix has some really good shows their prices are on a monthly basis which is high as compared to amazon prime. I got this sat 499/year and even now 999/year it's a steal deal in my fank opinion I have binged watched 2 broke girls all seasons and amazon originals are just Mind blowing. You get to see Indian comedy artists like - Zakir Khan performing exclusively which is a cherry on top. Both app and website have a no buggy smooth experience and consumes very low data .one word - Wonderful.   
Not Satisfied.,Hello Friends i am sumit and I am going to tell you my experience will the amazon prime videos.     I opted to buy the prime membership to watch latest movies but it is very disappointing that the new content atleast take 1 month to upload.     Their is no option to lock the screen.it takes a minute to play in its best quality through the wifi is working at its max.     Their is no option to download the videos which is quite disappointing and the person who wants to watch in offline has no option.     The application of the amazon prime has a little bug and crashes.     I deleted the application later and use it on my laptop   
Excellent,Amazon prime videos are great the have lots of new series like suits super natural and lots of othe the quolity of videos are great with great features they have all the new contents and the contents are categorise with the kids movies and tv shows section. its worth of money other than hotstar or netflix.   
Amazing quality contents totally worth it.,I am subscribing the amazon prime video since it's first launch in india. I must say it's really good with lots of latest movies and amazon prime original contents.     I am really enjoyed to watch the comedy show of kenny sebastian called 'Don't be that guy'. and I am also watching some of latest hollywood movies on it.     But obviously there are some missing contents like regular tv shows you can't get all your daily shows on amazon prime but I think it's also coming soon.     So overall I love to have the amazon prime video subscription and I think it's totally worth the money of 999/year. You also love to have it.   
This is not fare for slow net!,I had a phone coolpad cool 1 from amazon. So amazon prime video app is pre-installed. This app is useful for only fast internet speed like 512kbps above. This starts with Ads also. And it has no many channels. Only this app has more english channels than hindi channels. And also its interface is not actractive.   
Good apps for movies and songs,This is the good apps for watching movies and listening songs.     It provide latest release songs infact its whole album and movies in multi languages and in different categories like animation Hollywood Bollywood and etc.     Sometimes its provide latest release song and movies in late.     But its good for watching movies its batter than surfing much time on internet for movies.   
Not so good service,Amazon prime video provide videos TV shows movies etc. But you can't watch TV shows before telecast where as Hotstar premium service provide tv shows before telecast in TV and now hot star premium service is free via Jio network. You can't watch new movies in Amazon prime video before telecast in television. That's why it's not so good.   
Amazon Prime Video,Hello readers     I am a member of amazon prime from past 4months. Using amazon prime video from initially.The quality of prime videos is available in 3 types. Depending upon best quality video the data consumes. I usually watch more movies in prime. Not all movies are there only few movies which were running will be updated.Some times the movies which were running in theature the same movie is available in Prime videos.People who have busy schedule and unable to watch movies in theature can really use prime videos.     There are also other videos tv shows and comedy shows available in different languages.     Not every time you need to stream videos. Because there is option to download videos in app. Where you can keep videos offline and watch later.     I paid Rs.500/- for prime membership for 1 year. You can use the same amazon account in multiple devices which is so helpful to me.     Thank you   
Amazon prime video,Amazon prime video is very good and I can see any movies and tv show and many more I try one month prime membership still buy one year membership and we can search any thing he show in hd quality and this is very good but the membership is little high 999 per year for see movie's and videos I know but data consubtion is high this is good but little expensive   
Limited catalog...,I've been using Amazon Prime Video App for three months. When compared with Netflix the catalog is much limited. Although all the leading series are included in the catalog less importance is given to the regional content. The recent Amazon Original series "Inside Edge" is very much predictable just like any other bollywood movie. Also the app has many issues. The setting options are good for streaming. The problem comes while downloading movies/ episodes. Sometimes the download will not complete. To resolve this you need to go to settings and then App permissions. You need to enable the permissions. For those who are not technically sound this is a very big task. Sometimes the download proceeds with the mobile data but not with the WiFi network. To resolve this you need to clear the data of the app and set the permissions as mentioned above and try again. Even if the issue persists you need to uninstall the app and restart the device. Once your device is on install the app try the steps mentioned above. My suggestion is that the app makers should make these troubleshooting steps handy on the website. They should optimise the app and make it work well with all the devices.   
No fresh content,I am using amazon prime vedio's as a premium member. So I have access to all there content but I see lack of new content no doubt they have many hit english tv series but most them are old.     On the name of new content they add amazon exclusive series and recent flop bollywood and hollywood movies.     Very bad collection of animation movies and they dont have popular english tv series like- flash arrow super girl originals game of thrones and vampire dairy People's who still watch old english tv series can go for amazon prime     I am bored with amazon in like 6 months.     Though amazon prime provide every content with sub-titles and in high quality.   
Never use Amazon prime for fast delivery,Hi all I come again with my another bad experince with order number 405-6117738-7277939 order date is November 10 2017 qnd delivery date is November 12 2017 as I am a prime member of Amazon.in but still I am not get my product and order status is shows delayed your action is required.     This happened second time in a month with two different order number .     Now I am angry and helpless because there customer support representative also not provide any needfull help I am also attach the screenshots of delivery status.     So never buy any product from Amazon.in if you are a prime member and looking for urgent delivery.     To buy an Amazon prime membership is tottaly waste of money.   
NOT SATISFIED WITH THE VIDEO QUALITY.,VOOT  You Tube  Hotstar.etc etc Every Video app is Having a Lot of options But There is NO QUALITY check On The prime Video and No Lock Screen Option too.     And I Am Upset at the Fact That Even Wifi is working at its Maximum Speed but Still Video won't Play in its best quality Ever.     I Like Amazon Shopping App Because With every New Update they bring something New . but unfortunately this is not in the Case of Amazon Prime Video.     Disappointment come with Every New update.     This app Is actually A Trash Or we can say Garbage .     I have not watched Even a Single show a Single Movie as I can't cast it to my TV Using Samsung S5.     Again This is not Suitable to Android Users .     In simple Words I can say That Certainly and Surprisingly The worst Video Player That I'd ever Used.     Crashes are so Regularly on resuming the history.     At Last I Had done a great Job By Deleting this app forever From My Android Phone.!   
Every content is premium,I am a persional user of amazon prime video and I am totally in love with this app. If you a movie lover web series lover than this membership is only for.it take less data.     This app use data as per the quailty of the video you can change quailty from setting     Best 0.46 gb data per hour     Better 0.26 gb data per hour     Good 0.18 gb data per hour     Data saver 0.12 gb data per hour     Layout and design is very simple and clean it looks beautifull.     On the whole amazon prime video is all about beautifull content in Rs499 per year. This app is value for money for video lovers.     Yes I am a movie lover   
One of the best,Its helping the most people all around the world.iam so happy about it another way to watch the videos u like amazon being the best shopping app is also providing these kinds of things well done amazon the picture quality and resolution is the best combo of this amazon prime hope u invent new things and present to us thank u amazom   
Read This And Chose,If You Are Planning To Join Amazon Prime Video Then You Should Read This Or Take A Trial of 30 days given by Amazon.     Main Specification:     1] Video Quality - Better(only if 4G is Available May Cause Problem For 3G User)     2] Audio Quality - Low     3] Subscription Charge - 499/yr(will change to 999/yr soon)     4] Data Saving- No     5] Movies Placed - Afther World Television Premier     6] Loading Time- Moe Than 30 Second(Depends On Net Speed)     7] Desing- Better     8]Function- Many Time show loading or sometime app automatically stop     9] Storage- May Hang Your Mobile     10] App Size -     11]Advertisement- No     In this days we have available various free entertainment services like hot star voot etc. But Amazon is taking rs.499 as subscription charge this year and it will increase and will become 999 for next year. Amazon prime video is giving Best video quality only if you have better internet speed amd if you are user of 3G or 2G then it will be problem for you. But If You are Thinking about Audio Quality it is not acceptable as you are paying. This Cocpet Of Taking Data+ Subscription Charge Is Not Affordable To 97% Indians. Everyone Thinks For Paying To This Site/App. Also If We Have Paid They Are Also Not Decreasing Data Rates Required. There No Data Saving Which We Can See In Various Browser Like UC.     If You Are Thinking Afther Paying This You Will Get Pure Entertainment Then It Is Failed. If You Will See Movies They Are Giving Thoose Movie Which Have Been Played On Television And Also Available On Internet. Now At Time Of Writing This Review There Latest Movie Is Simran And Tublight. We All Know Tubelight Has Shown Worst Performance And Also It Has Been Played On Television It Was Relesed 4 Month Ago So It Doest Come In Category Of LATEST.     So If Until You Are In Mood Of Using This Service Take One Month Free Experiance And Chose Yourself   
Excellent,Its very good and its features are excellent. Once you get the full version monthly a new movie gets added. The movies whivh get added are nice movies. You can watch nice movies in app. You can enjoy watching the movies. You need to pay 500rupees only for a year and u can watch not only movies but some comedy shows   
Descent app,The app is descent and easy to use but the interface could have been more user friendly .     Although the content provided is good and value for money but time lag is more as compared to others like hotstar and netflix .     Amazon prime own series is good and worth watching     the beauty of anime adds up to the other effect and is good and gives it an extra advantage over other applications but I will still say this could have been much better and worthy .   
Nice app,I was actually surprised by the amount of content it's a huge collection of movies and tv shows and the best part is it cost you only 499 a year.There is a lot of good movies and programs on here I do like.However a lot of them I get free.we need choremecast support.The streaming quaility is good and please add some dubbed movies   
Affordable entertainment app,There are a lot of other exciting series like the game of thrones tv shows and comedy shows lile the going virals etc. This gives complete entertainment to our family of people belonging to different age groups depending on their interests. The news of the new shows will be updated to you on your amazon app or even in tv commercials This is truly affordable and this membership offers you unlimited access to the Amazon Prime videos by installing this app on your smart phones. You can watch a lot of shows and movies under various Genres with unlimited download options as well I have got the Amazon Prime membership by paying less than Rs 500 for an year.     Watching bollywood movies and I use Amazon Prime Video for it. I have seen a lot of movies posted on it the recent ones being Meri Pyari Bindu Trapped Hindi Medium Rabta and so on. This gives us a hazzle free source of entertainment. My son also loves watching kids movies and he has seen movies like kunfu panda the smurfs and all One thing that is quite impressive thing is that it is giving one month trial to every user to experience it gives all the series of action comedy drama etc etc serials like Game of thrones It is showing all the latest movies in best picture quality. The most interesting thing is that it is allowing access to the latest TV series

India's Netflix..!,Recently Amazon launched this 'Amazon Prime Video' for viewing their shows for mobile devices.

Amazon Prime Video has put up a great user interface just like apps like Netflix HBO GO ( In US) do. One of the rising and trending app which is attracting users.     The shows like 'Inside Edge' or events like 'Haq Se Single' are surely doinf their job of making this app more beautiful and enjoyable.     Hats off amazon.! We were missing something like this.

Addicted to it!!,Amazon Prime Video is one of my best digital Video provider in India. As there is a serious competition between Netflix Hotstar OZee I feel like this is one of the best digital Video provider. It has really good design made in a Application and at a good speed and also no lagging. & Regarding the content it has really good collection of movies and also the series which are really the best because it has Amazon originals which Exclusively produced by them and it has also made special series for India called Inside Edge by which I can say its worth to watch. They normally bollywood movies very fast and which is the best for me.     And regarding the price its just 499/- per annum and which is really less compared to competitors like Netflix Hotstar etc. Because in this we can watch online content also we can shop too at a exclusive Prime customers. So overall this application is the best.     3.9/5

Good App,I got Amazon Prime Video's free subscription with Amazon Prime Membership. As it was free I enjoy watching movies and stand up comedians which I never knew existed ; -) It does not have latest movies but still it is enjoyable as you can see TV Shows from US as well.

Good App for quality Movies and TV series,Amazon Prime Video is a very good option for watching quality movies and TV series. They have a nice collection for all age type.

He watches'Oggy  and  Cockroaches' on it almost daily after coming from school and it makes him very happy and for me it becomes easier to feed him lunch. My internet connection is not very good but still it does not effect video quality. so I am happy with it and recommend it to others.

On Amazon Prime Video There Are Lots Of New Movies Are Available And Many Of TV Shows Are Available Which Are Not Free On Youtube.

Nothing new in prime video,There are many online videos available for watching like other paid online video sites in which we as a whole used to see motion pictures on the web. Prime Video is the same. I think Hotstar is a superior one than this. The Thought utilized by the designers is the old one that was made by numerous bloggers. All they are attempting is to make some interest in this manner field. I think it will be better in the event that you go For nothing JIO television. what's more purchase a top notch enrollment on hotstar. I think the main this which this thing is doing great is the 30 days free trial. Everything else is now imagined and has been utilized by a huge number of client over the world. Just the same old thing New.

Superb Prime Video,Amazon has done one of the best thing in the form of Amazon Prime Video. Amazon is fulfilling the craziness of the youth by giving all the series of action comedy drama etc etc serials like Game of throne Shaktimaan transparent Hands of God. It is showing all the latest movies in best picture quality. The most interesting thing is that it is allowing access to the latest TV series like vampire dairies 2 broke girls.     One thing that is quite impressive thing is that it is giving one month trial to every user to experience its "amaizingness" after that its subscription charges is just rupees 499/- for the an year.   
Amazon? Amazing? Amazong?,Prime Videos was released about a year ago and I have to admit the availability of content has been increasing since the first day it came out. I got my prime membership for a bargain of Rs. 200 only and it has been the best 200 I have spent in my life. There are full seasons of many series like Two and half men and several Amazon exclusives.     With the availability of the app on my smart TV I enjoy content of my choice on the TV any time I want to rather than seeing Suryavansham on Set Max every time.     I suggest you get Prime membership asap because the benefits far outweigh the costs.

Amazon prime,The amazon prime is not much useful. It is waste of joining in the prime. The reason is that I have ordered two products through the prime 7 days back.

For a normal order on any online trade it will take 2-3 days for delivery which is tolerable but amazon ( prime ) taking more than enough time to deliver the order.

Movies for free is a treat from Amazon,Amazon prime video is a new delight from Amazon to watch and enjoy Hollywood as well bollywood movies absolutely in HD print. Amazon prime video contains all kind of movies from romance to comedy and from horror to suspense.     Another plus point of using amazon prime video is that we can find old movies as well as latest movies also.     The feature which makes this app must have is that we can download any movie for free in HD print as well as of low size but this is valid for 1 month only then you have to pay to watch movies.     But paying for this app is totally worthy as it gives you amazing quality to deal with.   
Amazon Prime Video,Just sign in to amazon prime video  and start using it .     Because I was just curious about this new amazon service.     Its actually provide vast collection of movies & TV shows allowing you to either watch it online or download it for later.     Amazon prime has good collection but most of movies are latest you merely found any classic movies here so for classic lovers nothing here.     But the content quality is very very good.!     Web portal & app design is quite good  & user friendly not unwanted stuff like adds & other things only content related things are on scree. So very simple & good layout.     But search should be improved as currently its mixed with videos & movies of all languages.     Search should be more specific(Language).     Right now amazon provide this service free for 30 days on trial basis so just enjoy!     After   
Bad quality,This is very bad app for videos online .

Amazon prime video review best,Amazon prime video is the free trail new movies to watch in 30 days free trail. This is the concept of the high quality of the realease movies in watch on free .It is used handle very easy to sign up the email account and the sign in to watch high quality of video and sound .This is feature of free movies in 30 days and usefull ness of the with out investment money .Get loved movies freely watch.   
Nothing That Much Special,Like other paid online video websites in which we all used to see movies online. Prime Video is the same. I think Hotstar is a better one than this. The Idea used by the developers is the old one that was created by many bloggers. All they are trying is to make some investment in thus field. I think it will be better if you go for FREE JIO TV. and buy a premium membership on hotstar. I think the only this which this thing is doing well is the 30 days free trial. Everything else is already invented and has been used by millions of user across the world. Nothing New.   
Why would anyone go to amazon prime!,I have downloaded this from play store.and I found it good but the bad thing is that it is too costly.the specification of this app is good but there exist other app that have these specifications too.i recommend all of you not to use this app.use other app in the market.in india this app offers 1 month free trial for all.download this app from play store and just enjoy the free trial and uninstall this .   
I don't think it is usefull.!!,I don't think it is usefull in india because there are many sevral live tv & video app are available in india. This app is free but it is only available for 30 days for Trail use only and some channels are not free of cost. So I suggust you to please don't use this app. I prefer you to please install hotstar or voot app and the best part is that it is free of cost and all premium channels are free of cost. Thank you for support.!   
Nice Prime videos,It has good show . Glod to be a Prime chstomer after trial. Nice to watch shows from season 1 . Please develpaper kodi addon as I watch media only using kodj - Pc . How about windows 10 uwp? Also we are paying to watch shows. Then why censor and spoil our experience? Its not live tv . Self appointed'Sanakarit police'?     Just the right kind of entertainement requrid . Amazing pictures and sound quality . Rich content and oringinals and to top it up you jave GrandTour one of my favorite tv hosts whith aww inspiri g cars and challeges you have just made TopGear a thing of the 1800s . Kudos to amazon for bringing prime to India and again revolutionizing prime time entertainment.   
Amazon Prime Video what fun without a screen cast,Amazon Prime Video what fun without a screen cast. Never thought Amazon though so late to compete with likes of Netflix would be so laid back in terms of its features as well. The look and feel is pretty old fashioned seems as if it has launched in haste. The biggest flaw I cannot watch it on my big screen LED smart TV I opened the app on my phone and saw there is no cast button to cast it over my TV or any other device this is so so old school. It seems suddenly the world has gone back all the way.     I would rate it 2 out 5   
Average,The amazon prime video chips away at the idea that it is a film watching entryway. it is somewhat on the costly side when contrasted with other . the application gets constrain shut numerous a circumstances . the application has a noteworthy issue that even you are utilizing a rapid web association the application downsize the quality and it stalls out in the wake of playing for 30 min once in a while . the format is alright and there is nothing great about it the capacities are likewise alright the application is not that helpful and effortlessly be abstained from considering the cost   
Below Average,The amazon prime video works on the concept that it is a movie watching portal. it is slightly on the expensive side as compared to other . the app gets force closed many a times . the app has a major problem that even you are using a high speed internet connection the app downgrades the quality and it gets stuck after playing for 30 min sometimes . the layout is ok and there is nothing impressive about it the functions are also ok the app is not that useful and easily be avoided considering the price   
Amazon prime arrives in india,Amazon prime is a good step ahead by the e-retail giant amazon in india. It faces a tough competition from the likes of hotstar and netflix but I am pretty sure that prime will hold its own ground. It has a good and easy to use interface which could be figured out by any general user. The content of this platform is great as amazon had tied up various famous indian content creators and has all signed contracts with famous international shows to bring in some of the best content out there to their platform.its a must use for any avid content lover as a non user is missing out on some serious content out there.its quite cheap when compared with its competition so it has a higher chance of being a success. Get your subscription now to start binging on prime.??   
PRIME COMES TO INDIA,Earlier prime was only limit to abroad countries. But few months ago Amazon started its prime membership in India too.     With this membership u can get many more advantages than a normal customer . U can get 15 minutes early access to any product. And 1 -2 months ago amazon also started its prime video in India. In this u get access to thousand of movies and tv shows which are popular in abroad as well as India too. u can download any time and watch it any time as whatever is your need. But if you are member of amazon prime then only you can access the amazon prime video.

Amazon prime video is so costly,Amazon prime video is very costly. I download this app from playstore. I watch a movie by paying money. It so costly. I prefer to download movie or watch it on Vidmate in free of cost. The video quality is good and every movie is easily available on this store. I like to say that if you want to watch movie you can see on vidmate or download it utorrent.

This would be best if allow to stream live Cricket,Hi     I am going to share my Amazon Prime Video experiance in rewiew via mouthshut.com.     Before I say something lets check what it is Amazon Prime?     Simply if I say then its like "Hotstar or Jio cinema" .Agree?     But the difference b/w hotstar and this app"Live streaming".

Only oneIts only 30days free trial.After 30days you have to pay 499/month.Not for only using prime video app including amazon.in Prime service.     And yesI know You will not pay anything.Me too.

Amazon Prime video is a average app.,Hi Friends     I want to share my experience by Amazon Prime Video app.i had installed this app recently but this was not up to my expectations.The concept of the app is we can watch Tv shows movies videos on this app.But the video quality is not HD.The app is also somewhat slow and it takes a long time to open the videos.the design of the app is good and it is attractive.If we watch videos online then there is a disturbance with adds.This app takes more space so my mobile performance is becoming slow y this app.It does not contain all programs.     This app is average and it was not up to my expectations.I would not recommend this app as it was slow and not much useful.So Friends think before you want to experiment this app because it was not so good.     Thank you.   
Not good performance,Hello Everyone I am telling about the Amazon Prime Video app which did not liked me.Recently Amazon launched this application in Android IOS and Window.Yesterday I was watching TV and I saw its ad than I instantly downloaded this application in my android phone.After install this take the much time during open this and its login process is bad.I tried login with my Amazon account but its not logged in and I would changed passward of my Amazon shopping site but it has not changed.I faced many problems with login process.After that I created new account and logged in but its performance was very poor.Overall this app is not good.It has some errors that is not comfotable for any phone.This app is doing some problem in my phone like as its automatically closed and downloading problem.It is take much space of phone memory.By the way its layout and design is very attractive and good but its very high graphical which is take much internet data and take much opening time.The main disadvantage of this app its service is paid after 30 days.This app is giving only trial service for 30 days.Amazon prime video is not good from Netflix app.Its concept is not good because many application available on internet which are gives free service.So its concept not good.In this app features is limited and not much better.However this app is useful but its take much internet data while we are playing any video in this app.So guys acoording my above details I do not recommend this.     Thank you.!   
New and best TV and Video app on the internet!,The new Amazon Prime Video is the latest TV and movie platform on the app stores introduced by AMAZON! It is available for a free 30 day trial for new users and I have downloaded the app and writing about my experience with the app.     Before everything Amazon Prime Video is a live TV and movies app which has all the latest and old movies and TV shows available at your fingertips. They are offering a free 30 day trial and after that they will charge Rs. 499 for a month. The app is very nice and has a very interactive interface! Everything is available on the app!        LIVE TV!        HOLLYWOOD MOVIES!        VIDEO MUSIC!        BOLLYWOOD MOVIES!        VIDEO CHANNELS and much more.           Also it provides facility to download and save videos offline if you wish to watch them later or so. Great and useful app.     Full of entertainment and joy.     Certainly I recommend the app to all and I will subscribe the app even after the trial period for sure!   
Honest Review: Amazon Prime Video,I tried the Amazon Prime one month free trial and I was hooked up to it to the core. I am usually the English TV series person and this app has a lot of English TV series available for just Rs 499/- a month. This is a version of Netflix and is very pleasant.     Amazon Prime can be easily downloaded from Google Play store and you can sync it with your Amazon Shopping App so it takes all the login information from there. There’s a quick tour of the app when you first install it and start using it.     The app is very easy to understand and it has a huge library of good movies and TV series. Amazon Prime has some Prime Exclusive series too which are worth a watch.     Features on the Amazon Prime Video App:     When you open the app you see the Home Tab – Under the Home Tab you’ll see the following:     a. The New Arrival and Best Collection on the Top     b. If you have started using Prime – it then has the Watch Next Sub-tab which will have the on-going or seen movies / TV Series     c. Amazon Original Series: This has some real good collection of the Prime original series. I am real eager to watch ‘Good Girls Revolt’     d. Latest Movies: This will have the latest movies in the Amazon Prime Collection. At the moment I can see – Baar Baar Dekho Fan etc. I feel they can have some more good collection in movies. Maybe they have more collection in the purchased version. I am currently in the last few days of my free trial.     e. Latest TV: This has the collection of TV series that are in their library. I am currently watching Mom. And believe me a review is up for that TV series     The Home Tab covers many different categories and has the ‘See more’ clickable option next to every category.     The app has an easy to use ‘Search’ tab. You can simply type and search your TV Series or movies are in there.     There’s also a ‘Download’ link when you open the Series or movies I am sure it is to watch the series/ movie offline.     This app is an absolute delight and given the fact that the quality is changeable as per your WiFi/Data saving skills are awesome.     Am I happy with Amazon Prime?     Yes. It is not as good as Netflix but it is certainly in the race.     Will I purchase the Plan?     Yes certainly.     Will I recommend it to others?     Of course!   
Online video nice concept,Amazing prime video is base on online movie serial and video watch     Waise to kafi iss tarah ke concept ki app he iss me Amazon ne entry li he but collection aur freshness wise kuch hatke lag rahi he yeh app so starting experience of good     App design is good looking simple and beautiful     Function easy to use and very smooth app usege not more bug this is good for slow net connection user     Overall not new concept but collection and new video availability is useful to this app I rated 4 star for this app   
Satisfactory work till now,With a totally different idea of business amazon a leading online shopping store now introduces amazon prime video in which one can watch any movies whether indian or hollywood at a very low cost. Not only this on a new registration they also give an access to watch 30 movies of any kind totally free. This new start of amazon will take some time to get published completely but once it will get famous it will also get fame just like youtube. Amazon prime video is available on website as well as an android app thus a person can enjoy watching movies whether on laptop or on the mobile on the go or travelling   
Amazing Amazon,For example in addition to providing an overall star rating for a product you can rate and comment on individual features of that product-such as battery life on an iPod Nano. You can also create new attributes to rate.Customer Ratings is currently a beta feature and is not yet available for every product.   
This is the best app,Its awesome and very very nice app it is useful for all of us we can buy anything from tis app products are awesome and the amazing amazon prime video is also best I have seen my favourite video on it and the app is used also for knowledge I don't have any complaints with this app so I say that who didn't download this app should download   
Excellent,It was very useful app with low price and good qualitygood discount and offers available in this .It has very good customer support in india best online shopping ever.Service from amazon is very good and fastest online shopping than others got the delivery before the on time it is good for cheap and best quality products online payment and cash on delivery is excellent .getting frew coupon cards is also very good.   
Amazon Prime Video,Great featured site launched by Amazon. The concept of gathering all videos like movies shows series Hollywood or Bollywood is really great and unique. One will find all desired movies series shows in one place with great picture and sound quality. It was designed so uniquely don't have to shuffle here and there for desired videos every video were well categorized and search option is also there for direct search of any desired video. We can change the language option too for the Hollywood movies into Hindi. We can add the movies or shows to watch later option where the watch later list toolbar separately shown in the site which makes viewing much more convenient. Best ever any video viewing site. The website is also comes with 30 days free trail and if one feel useful can purchase the membership with very nominal rates.   
Giving out free for one month,Its awesome like none another and the viewing interface of the videos was very nice and the audio and video quality was quite nice.featuring some prime content its was awesome seeing the videos but the think I will suggest it has some less content to become popular in india and they can work with many more things and I think it was useful to see its also giving out free trial for the first month and its good step to attract consumers and gain more of them by amazon but the fact is video for being popular in india is less   
Amazon,Amazon is the no 1 official shoping site in india it is easily found many products shirts shoes paints etc it is the easily provide free home delivery any products you have complaint it is easily returned amazon address it is the no 1 site of the other shoping site like snapdeal flipkart etc. Amazon is easily use in any computer phone tablet it is the best idea off shoping always amazon gives the heavy discount me   
Not so much material available but still good App,Amazon is offering a good platform for watching videos including movies episodes and many other things but the only issue is they have very less material available. eg:- I searched for different movies that are easily available on google but not on Amazon Prime. So my suggestion to them is to enhance their limits and make more customers happy. The layout and design of app is good and it is very simple to use. No buffering while playing videos online. It also offers the different options like download the video etc.   
GREAT online shopping website,I have been buying lots of things from Amzon and I am very thankfull to amazon It gives me well things every thing I bought from amazon is pretty good. I know that employees have some issues with this company but I find their service is world leading. Delivery is usually on time returns are handled quickly and fuss-free. More and more they are my go-to supplier. The best thing I got selfie stick I got a selfie stick in 120+ delivery charge 50 its is like 1000rs.selfie stick in this price I always use amazon for buying anything   
8 Reasons Why Amazon Prime is Worth $99,    With the current pricing schedule being$99 per year your cost per month for Amazon Prime was$8.25/month.        And if you’re a student Amazon offers a 6-month free trial but that’s not all: Amazon Prime for students is just$49/year!        Netflix currently charges$7.99 a month for access to their streaming titles. That’s it.$7.99 doesn’t get you a DVD in the mail once a month nor any of Amazon Prime’s other offered services.        Having an Amazon Prime Account gives you access to 500000 Kindle titles.        This. The biggest perk of having an Amazon Prime account is the free two day shipping on select products.        For those running their own companies either out of home or in a rented space Prime is virtually a must have        We’ve all been there. You’re in one store or another and you’ve picked up all the items you require only to step into the cue and see two or three more products that you want at relatively low prices.        Yes there are occasions in which you may find a product available online for a few dollars cheaper than you would on Amazon including shipping costs.      
VERY INTERESTING AMAZON PRIME VIDEO,AMAZON PRIME VIDEO IS BEST ONE TO USE     ITS REDUCING THE DATA USAGES     WHERE AS AMAZON COMPANY GIVING A ONE MONTH TRIAL PACKS     THAT KIND OF TRIAL PACK MORE AND MOST USEFUL TO KNOW ABOUT THE USES OF AMAZON PRIME VIDEO     ITS CLARITY WAS VERY HIGH IN NATURE     LAYOUT AND DESIGNS ARE VERY INTERESTING TO SEE     THEY HAVE A MANY FEATURES AND FUNCTION WITH THEM     ITS VERY USEFUL ONE TO DOWNLOADING AND WATCHING SUCH TYPE OF VIDEO
